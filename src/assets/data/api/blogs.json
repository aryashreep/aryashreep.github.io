It is a useful technique for discovering where your code may need upgrading (from PHP4 to PHP5).

Any class that inherits from an interface must implement the missing member function body. Interfaces is also an abstract class because abstract class always require an implementation. In PHP 5 class may inherit only one class, but because interfaces lack an implementation any number of class can be inherited. In PHP 5, interfaces may declare only methods. An interface cannot declare any variables. To extend from an Interface, keyword implements is used. PHP5 supports class extending more than one interface.<\/p>\n<p>interface interfacename<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tfunction name()<br \/>\n\tfunction name1()<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>class temp implements interfacename<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tpublic function name<br \/>\n\t{<\/p>\n<p>}<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>Example1 \u2013 Interface Class in PHP5<br \/>\n\t&lt; ?<br \/>\n\tinterface employee<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tfunction setdata($empname,$empage);<br \/>\n\tfunction outputData();<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>class Payment implements employee<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tfunction setdata($empname,$empage)<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\t\/\/Functionality<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>function outputData()<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\techo \"Inside Payment Class\";<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>$a = new Payment();<br \/>\n\t$a-&gt;outputData();<br \/>\n\t?&gt;<br \/>\n\tExample2 \u2013 Combining Abstract Class and Interface Class<br \/>\n\t&lt; ?<br \/>\n\tinterface employee<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tfunction setdata($empname,$empage);<br \/>\n\tfunction outputData();<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>abstract class Payment implements employee \/\/implementing employee interface<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tabstract function PaymentInfo();<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>class PaySlip extends Payment<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tfunction collectPaySlip()<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\techo \"PaySlip Collected\";<br \/>\n\t$this-&gt;outputData();<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>function outputData()<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\techo \"Inside PaySlip Class\";<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>function PaymentInfo()<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\techo \"Inside PaySlip Class\";<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>function setData($empname,$empage)<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\t\/\/Functionality<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n\t$a = new PaySlip();<br \/>\n\t$a-&gt;collectPaySlip();<br \/>\n\t?&gt;<\/p>\n<p><u>PHP Tutorial<\/u><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.udemy.com\/php-tutorial\/\">https:\/\/blog.udemy.com\/php-tutorial\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>DIQ,Drupal Interview question and answer<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/drupal-interview-questions.blogspot.com\/\">http:\/\/drupal-interview-questions.blogspot.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>english speaking URl<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/sawaal.ibibo.com\/computers-and-technology\/on-line-spoken-english-websites-462702.html\">http:\/\/sawaal.ibibo.com\/computers-and-technology\/on-line-spoken-english-websites-462702.html<\/a><\/p>\n"

With a strong presence of information technology companies and institutions, a major Drupal conference has been long missed in this city.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tDrupalCamp Bangalore will run on 25th and 26th of July, 2015. The first day will be filled with informative sessions related to Drupal, PHP, and web technologies in general. At the same time, the classic Drupal in a Day training will be conducted for everyone who are new to Drupal and willing to learn more about it to build amazing websites. The second and last day of a DrupalCamp is traditionally reserved for contributing to the Drupal project in an event called a \u201csprint\u201d, and DrupalCamp Bangalore will be no different. The camp will be packed with enough learning to help you take your skills to the next level.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tDrupalCamp Bangalore also makes business sense. The camp is kindly sponsored by several companies who work with Drupal or technologies around it. This will be an excellent chance for companies to interact with other organisations and come together to solve problems. It is also ideal for individuals to interact with these companies and get hired.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThis is the first ever held DrupalCamp in Bangalore.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tRegistration URL :\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/drupalcampbangalore.org\/\">http:\/\/drupalcampbangalore.org\/<\/a><\/div>\n"

In short: the \"root\" value for all the sites is the root of your Drupal installation. The \"uri\" value of the alias should match the folder in which the site is stored. To test, you can call drush @site1 status and drush @site2 status to confirm it's accessing in the right directories.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:18.0000pt;\">4. Enable\u00a0a\u00a0module\u00a0on\u00a0each\u00a0site\u00a0:\u00a0drush\u00a0@site1\u00a0en\u00a0moduleName\u00a0-y<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:18.0000pt;\">5. Drush has the ability to interact with each site within a multi-site installation via the @sites argument. Anytime you are within the directory structure of your platform, the drush @sites command will target all sites rather than a single\/no site.

Unicode casing alone is much more complicated than an ASCII-minded approach can handle. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tThe lowercase of \u201c\u1e9e\u201d is \u201c\u03b2\u201d, but the uppercase of \u201c\u03b2\u201d is \u201cSS\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThere are two lowercase Greek sigmas, but only one uppercase one; consider \u201c\u03a3\u03af\u03c3\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tLetters like \u201c\u00f8\u201d do not decompose to an \u201co\u201d plus a diacritic, meaning that it won\u2019t correctly sort.<\/li>\n<\/ul><div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThere are many other subtleties.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tutf8_unicode_ci uses the standard Unicode Collation Algorithm, supports so called expansions and ligatures, for example: German letter \u00df (U+00DF LETTER SHARP S) is sorted near \"ss\" Letter \u0152 (U+0152 LATIN CAPITAL LIGATURE OE) is sorted near \"OE\".<\/li>\n<\/ul><div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tutf8_general_ci does not support expansions\/ligatures, it sorts all these letters as single characters, and sometimes in a wrong order.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tutf8_unicode_ci is generally more accurate for all scripts. For example, on Cyrillic block: utf8_unicode_ci is fine for all these languages: Russian, Bulgarian, Belarusian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Ukrainian. While utf8_general_ci is fine only for Russian and Bulgarian subset of Cyrillic. Extra letters used in Belarusian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Ukrainian are sorted not well.<\/li>\n<\/ul><div>\n\tThe cost of utf8_unicode_ci is that it is a little bit slower than utf8_general_ci. But that\u2019s the price you pay for correctness. Either you can have a fast answer that\u2019s wrong, or a very slightly slower answer that\u2019s right. Your choice. It is very difficult to ever justify giving wrong answers, so it\u2019s best to assume that utf8_general_ci doesn\u2019t exist and to always use utf8_unicode_ci.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tSource: <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.mysql.com\/read.php?103,187048,188748#msg-188748\">http:\/\/forums.mysql.com\/read.php?103,187048,188748#msg-188748<\/a><\/div>\n"

The first step for all of these is to install the Sass gem:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>gem install sass<\/strong><\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tIf you\u2019re using Windows, you may need to install Ruby first.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tTo run Sass from the command line, just use<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>sass input.scss output.css<\/strong><\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tYou can also tell Sass to watch the file and update the CSS every time the Sass file changes:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">sass --watch input.scss:output.css<\/span><\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t<br \/><code><br \/>\n.funky {<br \/>\n  font: 2px\/3px;<br \/>\n    font-family: fantasy;<br \/>\n    font-size: 30em;<br \/>\n    font-weight: bold; }<br \/><\/code><\/div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><u><strong>CSS Extensions<\/strong><\/u><\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Nested Rules<\/strong><\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tSass allows CSS rules to be nested within one another. The inner rule then only applies within the outer rule\u2019s selector. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main p {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 color: #00ff00;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 width: 97%;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 .redbox {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 background-color: #ff0000;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 color: #000000;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t}<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tis compiled to:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main p {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 color: #00ff00;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 width: 97%; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 #main p .redbox {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 background-color: #ff0000;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 color: #000000; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tThis helps avoid repetition of parent selectors, and makes complex CSS layouts with lots of nested selectors much simpler. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 width: 97%;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 p, div {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-size: 2em;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 a { font-weight: bold; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 pre { font-size: 3em; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t}<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tis compiled to:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 width: 97%; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 #main p, #main div {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-size: 2em; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 #main p a, #main div a {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 font-weight: bold; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 #main pre {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-size: 3em; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tReferencing Parent Selectors: &amp;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tSometimes it\u2019s useful to use a nested rule\u2019s parent selector in other ways than the default. For instance, you might want to have special styles for when that selector is hovered over or for when the body element has a certain class. In these cases, you can explicitly specify where the parent selector should be inserted using the &amp; character. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\ta {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font-weight: bold;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 text-decoration: none;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 &amp;:hover { text-decoration: underline; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 body.firefox &amp; { font-weight: normal; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t}<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tis compiled to:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\ta {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font-weight: bold;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 text-decoration: none; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 a:hover {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 text-decoration: underline; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 body.firefox a {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-weight: normal; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&amp; will be replaced with the parent selector as it appears in the CSS. This means that if you have a deeply nested rule, the parent selector will be fully resolved before the &amp; is replaced. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 color: black;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 a {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-weight: bold;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 &amp;:hover { color: red; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t}<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tis compiled to:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 color: black; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 #main a {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-weight: bold; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 #main a:hover {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 color: red; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&amp; must appear at the beginning of a compound selector, but it can be followed by a suffix that will be added to the parent selector. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 color: black;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 &amp;-sidebar { border: 1px solid; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t}<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tis compiled to:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t#main {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 color: black; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 #main-sidebar {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 border: 1px solid; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tIf the parent selector can\u2019t have a suffix applied, Sass will throw an error.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Nested Properties<\/strong><\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tCSS has quite a few properties that are in \u201cnamespaces;\u201d for instance, font-family, font-size, and font-weight are all in the font namespace. In CSS, if you want to set a bunch of properties in the same namespace, you have to type it out each time. Sass provides a shortcut for this: just write the namespace once, then nest each of the sub-properties within it. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t.funky {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font: {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 family: fantasy;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 size: 30em;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 weight: bold;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t}<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tis compiled to:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t.funky {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font-family: fantasy;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font-size: 30em;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font-weight: bold; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tThe property namespace itself can also have a value. For example:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t.funky {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font: 2px\/3px {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 family: fantasy;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 size: 30em;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 weight: bold;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t}<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\tis compiled to:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;code&gt;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t.funky {<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 font: 2px\/3px;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-family: fantasy;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-size: 30em;<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 font-weight: bold; }<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\t&lt;\/code&gt;<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><u>More example on SASS coding\u00a0<\/u><\/p>\n<pre>\n$brand-color:#cc0000;\n@mixin border-radius($radius) {\n  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;\n  -moz-border-radius: $radius;\n  -ms-border-radius: $radius;\n  border-radius: $radius;\n}\n.no_display {\n  display:none;\n}\n#main{\n  text-align:center;\n    p{\n    color:$brand-color;\n    width: 97%; \n    }\n    .redbox {\n        background-color: #ff0000;\n        color: #000000;\n    }\n    div{\n         background-color: #ff0000;\n        color: #000000; \n        @include border-radius(16px);\n        @extend .no_display;\n    }\n}\n<\/pre>"

            "articleBody": "<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/panels\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Panels module<\/a>\u00a0allows a site administrator to create customized layouts for multiple uses. At its core it is a drag and drop content manager that lets you visually design a layout and place content within that layout. Integration with other systems allows you to create nodes that use this, landing pages that use this, and even override system pages such as taxonomy and the node page so that you can customize the layout of your site with very fine grained permissions.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tPanels uses Contexts - What are they?<\/h4>\n<p>In a Panel, you can create contexts, which represent the objects being displayed. For example, when displaying the node view, NID argument on the page is converted into a context through the 'arguments' system. You can then create a relationship from that node to, say, the node author, or if you have a node reference from CCK, a related node [as of CCK 2.3]. Once the contexts are in place, content specifically about those contexts can be placed. For the node context you can add CCK fields, the node body, attached files and a host of other information that can be provided by plugins. For the user context you can display things like the user picture or profile. Note that CCK 2.3 and later only has support for Panels 3.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, these contexts can be checked for information and use that not only to make content available to be displayed, but to choose which layout to display! For example, if your site is international, you can use context to see if the node being viewed is set for a particular language and choose to display it one way if it is in French or another way if it is in English. You can also select on attributes like node type, whether or not the user has access to edit the node, and more. This system is also pluggable and you can add your own custom criteria with only a small amount of code. Want to display nodes differently based on how a custom CCK field you've added to a node type is set? That is very simple to write and you can use this to change the presentation entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Panels also includes simpler applications of the drag and drop system. There is a node type (the 'panel' node) that can simply be added as content to your system. By being a node it loses a lot of the features that the more powerful page system has, but it does have the advantage of simplicity, and gaining all of the functionality that nodes normally get.<\/p>\n<p>Panels can also be used for items smaller than pages. What if you have a normal sidebar, and you have two pieces of content that waste a bunch of space because they're really too narrow, and your design looks significantly better if they are side by side? That's complex to do in Drupal because what you end up having to do is create a custom block with custom code to display these two pieces of content. With Panels, you just create a \"mini-panel\" with a two column layout. Add one block to the left, one block to the right, and finish. This mini panel will then be available to your system as an ordinary block, or as panel content to go in the other panels.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tOther Features of Panels<\/h4>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tPanels supports styles, which can control how individual content panes, regions within a panel, and the entire panel will be rendered. While Panels ships with few styles, styles can be provided as plugins by modules, as well as by themes!<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThe layout builder is nice for visually designing a layout, but a real HTML guru doesn't want the somewhat weighty HTML that this will create. Modules and themes can provide custom layouts that can fit a designer's exacting specifications, but still allow the site builder to place content wherever you like.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tPanels includes a pluggable caching mechanism. A single cache type is included, the 'simple' cache which is time-based. Since most sites have very specific caching needs based upon the content and traffic patterns, this system was designed to let sites that need to devise their own triggers for cache clearing and implement plugins that will work with Panels. Panels can be cached as a whole, meaning the entire output of the panel can be cached, or individual content panes that are heavy can be cached.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tPanels can be integrated with Organic Groups through the og_panels module to allow individual groups to have their own customized layouts.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tPanels integrates with Views to allow administrators to add any view as content. Or, for uses where the layout editor needs more tightly controlled content, Views can be given custom displays to provide only what the site administrator wants the panels builder to use.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n"

If this invisible field is filled out (bots will usually put in a value), then the form will return an error. Normal users (read: human beings) won't ever see the field, so they won't fill it out. Even if they do, the field is labeled in such a way as to indicate the human shouldn't fill out the field.<\/p>\n<p>This is not foolproof, though, as many spam bots can detect hidden fields, and they can also be adapted to work around a particular field on your site (this isn't typically the case for smaller sites, though). To prevent against this, you are able to change the field's name from the default, 'homepage', to whatever you'd like.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tConfiguration<\/h3>\n<div id=\"bvkf\"><\/div>\n<p>All settings for this module are on the Honeypot configuration page, under the Configuration section, in the Content authoring settings.

            "articleBody": "<p>Ideally, users will fill the web form with necessary information and finish their job successfully. However, people often make mistakes. This is where web form validation comes into play. The goal of web form validation is to ensure that the user provided necessary and properly formatted information needed to successfully complete an operation. In this article we will go beyond the validation itself and explore different validation and error feedback techniques, methods and approaches.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tValidation methods<\/h3>\n<p>User\u2019s input can be validated on the server and on the client (web browser). Thus we have server-side and client-side validation. We\u2019ll discuss pros and cons of each.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tSERVER-SIDE VALIDATION<\/h4>\n<p>In the server-side validation, information is being sent to the server and validated using one of server-side languages. If the validation fails, the response is then sent back to the client, page that contains the web form is refreshed and a feedback is shown. This method is secure because it will work even if JavaScript is turned off in the browser and it can\u2019t be easily bypassed by malicious users. On the other hand, users will have to fill in the information without getting a response until they submit the form. This results in a slow response from the server.<\/p>\n<p>The exception is validation using <strong>Ajax<\/strong>. Ajax calls to the server can validate as you type and provide immediate feedback. Validation in this context refers to validating rules such as username availability. You can read more about validation with Ajax in <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/jqueryfordesigners.com\/using-ajax-to-validate-forms\/\">this excellent tutorial<\/a> on jQueryForDesigners.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yahoo! sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/validation.png\" \/><br \/><em>This diagram shows differences between client-side and server-side validation and other techniques.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>\n\tCLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION<\/h4>\n<p>Server-side validation is enough to have a successful and secure form validation. For better user experience, however, you might consider using client-side validation. This type of validation is done on the client using script languages such as JavaScript. By using script languages user\u2019s input can be validated as they type. This means a more responsive, visually rich validation.<\/p>\n<p>With client-side validation, form never gets submitted if validation fails. Validation is being handled in JavaScript methods that you create (or within frameworks\/plugins) and users get immediate feedback if validation fails.<\/p>\n<p>Main drawback of client-side validation is that it relies on JavaScript. If users turn JavaScript off, they can easily bypass the validation. This is why validation should always be implemented on both the client and server. By combining server-side and client-side methods we can get the best of the two: fast response, more secure validation and better user experience.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.typepad.com\/secure\/services\/register?acct_level=pro\"><img alt=\"Typepad sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/typepad_validation2.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Rich, instant validation feedback is done on the client on TypePad<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat to validate<\/h3>\n<p>There are several different types of validation you can perform: required fields, correct format and confirmation fields.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tREQUIRED INFORMATION<\/h4>\n<p>The first and most obvious information that should be validated is required information \u2013 information without which operation cannot be completed successfully. Thus, validation has to ensure that the user provided all the necessary details in the web form and it has to fail if at least one of the fields is not provided. Required fields should be clearly marked in order to inform users about what information has to be provided up front.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.komodomedia.com\/blog\/2009\/06\/social-network-icon-pack\/\"><img alt=\"Komodo Media comment form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/komodomedia_required.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Required fields on Komodo Media blog comment form are marked with \u201crequired\u201d help text.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A common way to mark required fields is with an <strong>asterisk (*)<\/strong>. However, not all users know the meaning of an asterisk sign. Beginners or older users are very likely to have only a general idea of what an asterisk might mean. This is the reason why it is a good practice to either put a note on the top of the form that indicates that all fields marked with an asterisk are required or to use required field markers. In case that all fields are required there is no need to place asterisks or markers in the form. A simple message that all fields are required is enough.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/\"><img alt=\"Facebook sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/facebook_required.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Facebook doesn\u2019t provide information about required fields. Users get information that all fields are required only after they press the \u201csubmit\u201d-button.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Last year, we conducted an <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2008\/07\/04\/web-form-design-patterns-sign-up-forms\/\">survey on Web form design<\/a>. According to that survey \u201cdesigners tend to remove all unnecessary details and distractions which don\u2019t help the user to complete the form\u201d. More detailed analysis showed a trend of using very few mandatory fields \u2013 more than 50% of forms used at most 5 mandatory fields, while optional fields were often avoided. This can be useful to you when deciding on required fields.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tCORRECT FORMAT<\/h4>\n<p>Apart from ensuring that users provide necessary information, validation has to ensure that users provide information in the correct format. This applies to various cases such as email address, URL, dates, phone numbers and others. If the information is not in the correct format, users should be informed and correct format should be suggested. Probably the easiest way to validate the \u201ccorrect\u201d formatting is to use regular expressions.<\/p>\n<p>Please notice that it is often a good idea to <strong>not impose a strict input pattern on the users<\/strong>; it\u2019s better to actually permit users to enter text in a variety of formats and syntaxes, and make the application interpret it intelligently. The user just wants to get something done, not think about \u201ccorrect\u201d formats and complex UIs. Let the user type whatever he needs, and if it\u2019s reasonable, make the software do the right thing with it. This design pattern is also often called<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/designinginterfaces.com\/Forgiving_Format\">forgiving format UI design pattern<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.carbonmade.com\/signup\"><img alt=\"Carbonmade sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/carbonmade_format.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Carbonmade sign-up form validates URL format, informs the user about the error and provides ways to correct it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To learn more about regular expressions be sure to read <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2009\/06\/01\/essential-guide-to-regular-expressions-tools-tutorials-and-resources\/\">Essential Guide To Regular Expressions: Tools and Tutorials<\/a> or if you already know the basics:<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2009\/05\/06\/introduction-to-advanced-regular-expressions\/\">Crucial Concepts Behind Advanced Regular Expressions<\/a>. We\u2019ll discuss some other format techniques later in the article.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tCONFIRMATION FIELDS<\/h4>\n<p>When dealing with data that is important to the system, it is a good practice to let the users confirm their input using additional confirmation fields. This way users can be certain that they provided correct information. A typical case when confirmation field is used is for passwords, but it can be used in other cases like an email address.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/register.photobucket.com\/?ref=joinus\"><img alt=\"Photobucket sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/photobucket_confirmpassword.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Photobucket sign-up form required users to re-type password they previously entered in order to ensure it has been correctly entered.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A confirmation field should be placed next (or below) the target field. It has to clearly describe the purpose of the field such as \u201cConfirm your password\u201d. If two values do not match, the user should be informed. As an option, you can use a success indicator if values DO match.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2008\/07\/08\/web-form-design-patterns-sign-up-forms-part-2\/\">The second part of our survey<\/a> shows interesting information about confirmation fields. Email confirmation was mandatory in only 18% of sites, while password confirmation was mandatory in 72% of web sites. Surprisingly, large websites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Stumbleupon and Twitter don\u2019t require password confirmation.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tValidation feedback<\/h3>\n<p>If validation fails, the system should let the users know it by providing a clear and unambiguous message (usually one or two sentences) and ways to correct errors. Since users need to notice an error message immediately, it is a good practice to position it at the top of a web form, before all the other fields. This will also allow screen readers to easily access the message.<\/p>\n<p>The message should be shown preferably in red since this is the color that people usually associate with errors and it should contain an appropriate icon in order to get more attention. Icon should be globally recognizable, such as a red circle with white cross. This will also help people with visual impairments identify the meaning of the message. In addition to this, users should be informed about which input fields need to be checked.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/invoicemachine.com\/signup\"><img alt=\"The Invoice Machine sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/invoice_machine_feedback.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>The Invoice Machine Sign-up form doesn\u2019t provide error feedback. Error message is missing and input fields are colored with pastel red that is not easy to spot.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Apart from the error message and a list of invalid fields, the system should clearly mark fields that are invalid. This can be done in one of the following ways (or any combination of them):<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tBy providing red inline messages or markers next to every invalid field<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBy changing the background color or border color of invalid fields (to red)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBy changing the color of field labels<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBy providing error tips (balloons) next to each field<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>If you provide error tips or help, be short and informative. For example, if date is in an incorrect, format provide users with details on how to format it properly: \u201cThe date should be in the <em>dd-mm-yyyy<\/em>-format\u201d. It is sometimes also a good idea to have these hints as the initial value of your input fields. Thus, the user will first read the hint inside the input box and when he\/she will start typing the data, the hint will disappear.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tVALIDATION UPON SUBMIT<\/h4>\n<p>The \u201cclassic\u201d way to perform validation is when the <strong>user submits his data via the \u201csubmit\u201d-button<\/strong>. The validation is executed and if any errors are found, feedback is returned and displayed to the user. This way users will be able to fill the form without any interruptions. But, that could be a disadvantage as well. Users will be able to fix the errors only after they try to submit the form and get the response back from the server. This technique is typical for server-side validation, but can also be done on the client side.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.getballpark.com\/public\/signup?plan=5\"><img alt=\"Ballpark sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/ballpark_feedback.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Feedback on Ballpark sign-up form occurs upon submit. It shows an obvious error message with incorrect fields at the top of the form and marks each incorrect field with a tip.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>\n\tREAL-TIME VALIDATION (OR INSTANT VALIDATION)<\/h4>\n<p>In contrast to the previous technique, <strong>real-time-validation alerts users while they are filling in the form<\/strong>. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the validation is performed on every single key press but rather when a field loses focus. This way users will get immediate feedback about their input, e.g. if a username is available or if a date is in the correct format. Obviously, instant validation occurs during typing in an input field or after the input field loses focus. Usually, it is complemented with a text message, tip or a status icon.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/edit.yahoo.com\/registration\"><img alt=\"Yahoo! sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/yahoo_paswordstrength.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Yahoo registration form implements password strength meter that gives feedback as you type in the letters.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Instant validation should be implemented carefully and in appropriate cases because it might be distracting if overused or misused.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.typepad.com\/secure\/services\/register?acct_level=pro\"><img alt=\"Typepad sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/typepad_validation.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Sign-up form on TypePad not just provides instant validation feedback that informs users of different validation errors \u2013 it also indicates successfully entered information.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>\n\tWHAT TO AVOID?<\/h4>\n<p>There are two things you should really try to avoid when designing form validation. First, <strong>single error pages are bad practice<\/strong>. Singe error page means that users are redirected from the Web form they filled to a page that shows some feedback. In this case, users are forced to browse back in order to fix errors. When they browse back they will have to memorize the information you provided in the error message. The same applies to feedback messages in popup windows. Not only are popups annoying, but once they are closed all the feedback is lost.<\/p>\n<p>An interesting finding in <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2008\/07\/08\/web-form-design-patterns-sign-up-forms-part-2\/\">the second part of SM survey<\/a> is that \u201c30% of the forms displayed only an error-message at the top of the form (no input fields were highlighted)\u201d while \u201c29% had highlighted input fields with corresponding messages next to the input field (no error-messages were provided at the top of the page)\u201d. Only 25% used both error-messages and input fields.<\/p>\n<p>Probably the most surprising facts are that 14% of sites still use JavaScript popup for showing validation feedback, while Ajax validation is present only on 22% of sites. This shows big variations in validation feedback.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tBetter safe than sorry<\/h3>\n<p>Apart from the pure validation, there are several techniques that can help users make fewer mistakes. Although not all of these techniques can be considered validation, they do help by guiding users and preventing them from making mistakes.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tHELP HINTS<\/h4>\n<p>If a web form requires complex information to be filled in, help hints can significantly help users in the process of filling in the correct information. By guiding them how to fill particular information, you let them fill the form faster and avoid potential validation errors. Help hints are usually shown as simple text next to or above the input field. The design of help hints should differ from the design of form labels. It is usually shown in smaller, grayed text. The advantage of help information is that it is always visible to the user even if JavaScript is turned off.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wishlistr.com\/signup\/\"><img alt=\"Wishlistr sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/hints.jpg\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>WishListr provides useful help information on the right side of each field.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>\n\tHELP INDICATORS (TOOLTIPS)<\/h4>\n<p>In contrast to help hints, tooltips initially hide information and make it visible \u201con demand\u201d. They are usually triggered by an icon with a question mark. Help information is shown by hovering over the help icon or clicking on it. Once the mouse is moved away from the icon, the tooltip disappears. Help indicators can reduce clutter, especially if help text is too long.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/tickettrunk.com\/event\/add\"><img alt=\"TicketTrunk sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/ticket_trunk_help.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Sign-up form on TicketTrunk contains obvious help indicators that provide help information on hover.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>\n\tDYNAMIC TIPS<\/h4>\n<p>Similar to the previous case, dynamic tips are initially not visible to users. Once the user enters a particular input field, related tip is shown. This way tips are emphasized and clutter in the form is reduced. Tips should be shown in such a way that they don\u2019t cover other information on the form. They are usually shown next to input fields, but you should always try to place them on the right side of the fields since that is less distracting.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/digg.com\/register\/\"><img alt=\"Digg sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/digg_tips.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Digg registration form has discrete dynamic tips that show help information related to the field that has the focus.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>\n\tMASKING AND REFORMATTING USER\u2019S INPUT<\/h4>\n<p>Apart from validating user\u2019s input and assisting users, web applications can also take part in providing correct data by formatting user\u2019s input. This can be done by masking input fields in order to force users to enter information in an appropriate format. Mask is an expression that controls what users can enter in an input field. Masking can be implemented easily with one of the following plugins:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.meiocodigo.com\/projects\/meiomask\/\">meioMask<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/zendold.lojcomm.com.br\/imask\/\">iMask<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/typecast.arapehlivanian.com\/index.html\">TypeCast<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/digitalbush.com\/projects\/masked-input-plugin\/\">jQuery Masked input plugin<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/typecast.arapehlivanian.com\/index.html\"><img alt=\"TypeCast masking demo\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/typecast_masks.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/typecast.arapehlivanian.com\/index.html\">Typecast<\/a> demo page shows different masking options.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In some cases users might fill partially correct information or correct information but in different format. In those cases web application can provide a mechanism to correct and rewrite the user\u2019s input. Some of the possible scenarios when you might consider rewriting user\u2019s input are:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tif, for instance, a user enters URL without \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d prefix, the system can just add this string to the beginning of URL.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tif a user provides data in the <em>dd-mm-yyyy<\/em>-format, but the required format is <em>yyyy-mm-dd<\/em>, the system can rewrite the date so it is well-formed<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tif a user provides credit card number without dashes, the system can add dashes to appropriate positions in the credit card number<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/register\"><img alt=\"Tumblr sign-up form\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/tumblr_masking.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Tumblr provides a sort of masking for URL.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>These ideas are just some of the cases when this technique can be used. However, auto-formatting should be used carefully and \u2013 if not used properly \u2013 can be confusing to users. Also, not all user\u2019s input is predictable. If, for example, user enters \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine\u201d\">www.smashingmagazine\u201d<\/a> and omits the extension, the system can\u2019t assume that the extension is \u201c.com\u201d, but should rather raise a validation error.<\/p>\n<p>In this context it\u2019s again worth mentioning the \u201cforgiving format\u201d design pattern. Instead of restricting user\u2019s input to a specific format you can allow users to provide various formats and let the system parse it. In many cases this would require a lot of server processing; back-end would be responsible for parsing the input, extracting information and converting it to appropriate formats for further processing.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/calendar\/\"><img alt=\"Google calendar\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/google_calendar_format.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Google Calendar has a very clever implementation of this technique with one-field for adding events. Users can enter information in various formats (even use \u201ctomorrow\u201d instead of date); the system parses it and stores it as a new event. If user provides information that can\u2019t be parsed, system assumes that this information is event title and redirects the user to a longer version of the form with filled event name. This way Google completely omitted validation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>According to our survey. 67% of sites use help text and tips, 10% of which use dynamic tips. Surprisingly, only 26% of tips are positioned on the right side of the fields, while in other cases tips are positioned above, below and even on the left side of input fields.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tAre you human?<\/h3>\n<p>Web form validation wouldn\u2019t be complete without mentioning <strong>Captcha<\/strong>. Captcha is a significant part of validation as it is responsible for finding out if the user of a system is a human or a bot. In its simplest form, captcha consists of an image showing text, numbers or an expression and a field that expects content of the image as input. The earliest captcha generated images with numbers (e.g. \u201c8356\u2033) and that number was expected to be entered by the user. If correct number wasn\u2019t entered (or not entered at all), the form couldn\u2019t be submitted. In fact, today most spam bots are able to recognize the text embedded in a simple captcha-image, so it\u2019s a good idea to pose some question that only humans could answer correctly, e.g. \u201cWhat color does the Sun have?\u201d with correct answer \u201cyellow\u201d in all its variations (\u201cYELLOW\u201d, \u201cyellow\u201d, \u201cYellow\u201d etc.).<\/p>\n<p>You may also want to consider the technique called <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/haacked.com\/archive\/2007\/09\/11\/honeypot-captcha.aspx\">Honeypot Captcha<\/a> where the idea is to create hidden form elements and check on the server side that they remain blank. Another option is to create a form field with a label that says, \u201cLeave this field blank\u201d and then is marked as a required field (thank you,<em>Shawn McCool<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Captcha implementation\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/easy_captcha.png\" \/><br \/><em>Simple captcha requires an answer to a semantic question.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The kind of captcha presented above caused a major problem in accessibility. Blind, visually impaired or dyslexic users have difficulties or are even impossible to complete the web form with Captchas. As the Web evolved, so did captchas and today there are implementations like <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/recaptcha.net\/\">ReCaptcha<\/a> that have audio support for users with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/edit.yahoo.com\/registration\"><img alt=\"Recaptcha component\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/media.smashingmagazine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/images\/web-form-validation\/bad_captcha.png\" \/><\/a><br \/><em>Captchas can show hardly recognizable words. Can you easily read the word on the left?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Still most users hate captchas (and there is a good reason for hating them!). Of course, people just don\u2019t like filling in forms. If they can\u2019t do it fast and effortlessly, there is a high probability that they won\u2019t do it at all. This is where a captcha doesn\u2019t help at all: it can take too much time for users to read (if text is messy) which happens oft in practice. Remember, Captcha helps site owners, not their users. Therefore it\u2019s always a good idea to avoid using Captchas if you can avoid them.

Although there are many possibilities, you should carefully plan validation for each project. Not all techniques provide a solution for everything. Some of them are very helpful and easy to implement, but some lack usability and simplicity. If you are new to web form design here is a short list of what to consider in Web form validation design). That might be enough for you to start.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tRULES OF THUMBS IN WEB FORM VALIDATION DESIGN<\/h4>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tNever omit server-side validation.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tDon\u2019t provide confusing validation feedback. It should clearly communicate the errors and ways to fix them.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tDon\u2019t let users think about what information is required, always clearly mark required fields.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tNever provide validation feedback on a single page or in a popup alert.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tDon\u2019t use dynamic effects as compensation for a badly designed form. Fancy effects won\u2019t hide a poorly designed web form.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tIf you use Captcha, don\u2019t forget to provide audio support and enable users to \u201creload\u201d the Captcha.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tDon\u2019t forget to inform users when the form was completed successfully. It is as important as a good validation feedback.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Source : <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2009\/07\/07\/web-form-validation-best-practices-and-tutorials\/\">http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2009\/07\/07\/web-form-validation-best-practices-and-tutorials\/<\/a><\/p>\n"

These elements do not present new fields to users, so BOTCHA is completely transparent to humans. Both humans and bots submit those forms and BOTCHA performs heuristic analysis on each submitted form. Bots are usually programs\/scripts that are relatively dumb, and most of the time they fail BOTCHA tests and human users don't.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tOnce BOTCHA proves the submission is by a bot, the form submission is blocked.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThe more there are opportunities for the bot to slip and prove it is a bot, the better defense from spam we have. So we can combine multiple BOTCHA recipes as opposed to only one CAPTCHA per form. This gives huge advantage to BOTCHA.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<h2>\n\tAdvantages<\/h2>\n<div>\n\tThere are many advantages of BOTCHA over CAPTCHA:<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tBOTCHA does not bother normal human users<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBOTCHA tests are designed in such a way that normal users will never see them<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThere is no limitation on number of tests BOTCHA can implement on each form, so it gets progressively stronger<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tAs bots get smarter, BOTCHA will be updated with new recipes to defeat them<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBOTCHA needs very little configuration<\/li>\n<\/ol><div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tIt is possible to use BOTCHA alone without CAPTCHA. Nevertheless, it is recommended to use BOTCHA together with CAPTCHA. BOTCHA does not interfere with CAPTCHA, and more lines of defense are always better.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tURL :\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/botcha\">https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/botcha<\/a><\/div>\n"

The journey of the chariots represents the journey of Jagannath, Balabhadra and their sister Subhadra to the Gundicha temple, which is 3km from the Jagannath temple. The Rath Yatra day is the only day when non-Hindus can get a glimpse of the deities, since only Hindus are allowed inside the Jagannath temple.<\/p>\n<p>\tThe festival ends nine days later when the deities make their way back home to the Jagannath temple. The return journey, known as Bahuda Jatra, will be held on July 19.<\/p>\n<p>\tDevotees from different parts of the country and abroad attend this annual procession to get a glimpse of the deities, which is considered auspicious. The chariots are pulled with ropes by devotees amid chanting of hymns.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>WISH YOU A HAPPY RATH YATRA to YOU and your FAMILY !!!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"366\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/rath-yatra.jpg\" width=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>Good leadership demands various competencies, skills, knowledge and other attributes. The focus of what constitutes good leadership is mostly on what a leader knows which determines what he can do. Somehow character gets lost in the mix, even though it is this amalgamation of values and beliefs that determines how he will behave and react to situations. In other words, what he will do!<\/p>\n<p>Yes, character is one of the central elements of good leadership. A strong and sound character is what enables leaders to build excellence in the employees and in the organisation. Mr. Zarir Batliwala, HR Consultant, TeamLease Services says, \u201cA leader has to set the standard and lead by example. It is, therefore, essential that the character of the leader is unimpeachable. This is particularly true for the leader of a company who is accountable to multiple stakeholders \u2013 shareholders, customers, employees, government, analysts, etc.\u201d HCL Technologies too upholds that good character enables leaders to smoothly execute ideas, utilise employee potential, make right decisions and motivate staff to achieve results.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Amit Nandkeolyar, Assistant Professor, Organisational Behaviour at Indian School of Business (ISB) highlights an article by Shelley Kirkpatrick and Edwin Locke.<\/p>\n<p>He says, \u201cIt argued that while mere possession of traits does not make someone a great leader; there is strong evidence that effective leaders are different from others on certain dimensions. They suggested that these dimensions include drive, cognitive intelligence, honesty, integrity and trustworthiness.\u201d Johnson &amp; Johnson, one of the world\u2019s largest consumer health companies, views character as essential to good leadership as it can give the organisation a significant competitive advantage!<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the research angle, a popular meta-analysis by Timothy Judge and Joyce Bono further endorses that personality traits explain why some people are transformational leaders. In other words, character attributes like extroversion, agreeableness, courage and passion enable leaders to provide value-driven strategic direction to the organisation and inspire employees to achieve long-term, visionary goals.<\/p>\n<p><b>What makes good character?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>So what are the attributes that define good character? Is it about optimism and tenacity or honesty and humility or caring and respect or is it something else?<\/p>\n<p>Well, good character is exhaustive and pretty difficult to define. HCL Technologies believes that character itself cannot have a concrete definition and is the sum total of a person\u2019s behaviour, values and virtues. Moreover, it is an individualistic and situational phenomenon, as Ms. Juhi Mishra \u2013 Vice President - Human Resources, InterGlobe Technology Quotient says, \u201cThe traits that make up a good leader can vary depending on the organisation, your team and the environment that you are working in.\u201d Mr. Batliwala adds, \u201cA leader has to display one or more of the attributes at one time or the other and this is often situational.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, top leaders have to exhibit strong character traits in good, bad and difficult times.<\/p>\n<p>As Mr. Debasis Chatterji, CEO, Netxcell Limited puts it, \u201cSituations influence everybody and the leaders capable of handling such situations are not out of the world. It is the will-power of the leader to stick to the basic character under all kinds of circumstances which matters the most!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It follows that good character reflects in a leader\u2019s behaviour. They can be counted on to do what is right and hold themselves to high standards. Strong character helps them to make effective decisions, achieve results, progress quickly and also sustain the success. In the process, they win trust, loyalty and admiration and also become role models who inspire employees to emulate them and pursue excellence.<\/p>\n<p>To sum up, top leadership roles in the organisational hierarchy demand strong character traits than managerial skills or subject matter knowledge. Only then can they truly \u2018lead\u2019 the workforce!<\/p>\n<p>Payal Chanania<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:faqs@cnkonline.com\">faqs@cnkonline.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-features\/tp-opportunities\/in-leadership-good-character-counts\/article4165361.ece\">http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-features\/tp-opportunities\/in-lea...<\/a><\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>Being an effective leader is challenging and honest self-reflection is the key to creating a successful organisation. What is self-reflection? It means that you regularly examine the decisions that worked and those that didn\u2019t in your organisation. It means your day-to-day experiences are drawn on as learning opportunities, and options are explored or the choices identified. You look at your weaknesses, strengths, and your interactions within your team with a critical eye. This results in a higher level of self-awareness and a realistic view of oneself. It can be agonising, yet essential to look in the mirror and face the demon.<\/p>\n<p>\tThen turn your answers into positive, firm statements that will give you tangible goals you can work on immediately.<\/p>\n<p>\tAs you develop new leadership skills and insights, it leads to inspired and empowered employees, projects instilled with organisation\u2019s mission, vision and values, and a big picture vision that is linked to positive results.<\/p>\n<p>\tToday, the focus is on your ability to react to crises and make quick decisions. However, it is also important that you make it a habit to step aside and look back. Harry Kraemer, in his book From Values to Action says, \u201cThe journey to becoming a values-based leader starts with self-reflection.\u201d He further asks, \u201cIf you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself? If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? If you cannot lead yourself, how can you lead others?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\tSo, how does one get self-reflective? Pause for a while and answer a few hard questions \u2013 be honest!<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<strong>Where did I fail as a leader in the past? What could I do that would have made it better?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Where did I succeed? What qualities or values did I show of which I am proud?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Am I a cooperative leader? When did I last provide support and encouragement to my team or organisation?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Do I enjoy being a leader? If not, what can I do to increase my joy of being a leader?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Are there some aspects I am ignoring for fear of change or lack of knowledge?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>What can I do to become a proactive leader?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>What are my goals for my team or organisation?<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>What are the new skills I have learnt in the last one year?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\n\tWrite down the answers and analyse them. Develop a greater awareness of your strengths and explore challenging areas. Develop sound, positive leadership thoughts and skills.<\/p>\n<p>\tAnother way of looking back is careful observation. Analyse your own verbal and non-verbal communication. Note your tone and style used during meetings. How do you react when you face change, controversy, or crisis? Decipher the meaning of what you see and what you hear.<\/p>\n<p>\tBeing open to suggestions also helps build insights. Suspend your assumptions and look at things from a different perspective. Be prepared to listen with minimum defensiveness. Be open and curious even with people who disagree with you. Project yourself as a real person. Share your feelings that are believable. Otherwise, you may send mixed signals and come across as a manipulative leader.<\/p>\n<p>\tIt is important to respond in a flexible way. Responding with empathy and taking active interest in others is vital to managing relationships.<\/p>\n<p>\tMeditation, reading and maintaining a journal are some other ways that can help you in your journey of self-discovery and leadership.<\/p>\n<p>\tFinally, be prepared to do a reality check consistently and support your inner growth if you truly want to commit to becoming an effective leader. It requires personal discipline, hard work and continuous practice. <strong>Good luck!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-features\/tp-opportunities\/selfdiscovery-and-leadership\/article3805305.ece\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/todays-paper\/tp-features\/tp-opportunities\/selfdiscovery-and-leadership\/article3805305.ece<\/a><\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>PHP is an \"HTML-embedded scripting language\" primarily used for dynamic Web applications. The first part of this definition means that PHP code can be interspersed with HTML, making it simple to generate dynamic pieces of Web pages on the fly. As a scripting language, PHP code requires the presence of the PHP processor. PHP code is normally run in plain-text scripts that will only run on PHP-enabled computers (conversely programming languages can create standalone binary executable files, a.k.a. programs). PHP takes most of its syntax from C, Java, and Perl. It is an open source technology and runs on most operating systems and with most Web servers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"center\" style=\"\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/php-logo.gif\" style=\"width: 504px; height: 119px; float: left; \" \/><\/div>\n<div>\n\tPHP was written in the C programming language by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 for use in monitoring his online resume and related personal information. For this reason, PHP originally stood for \"Personal Home Page\". Lerdorf combined PHP with his own Form Interpreter, releasing the combination publicly as PHP\/FI (generally referred to as PHP 2.0) on June 8, 1995.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tTwo programmers, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rebuilt PHP\u2019s core, releasing the updated result as PHP\/FI 2 in 1997. The acronym was formally changed to PHP: HyperText Preprocessor, at this time. (This is an example of a recursive acronym: where the acronym itself is in its own definition.) In 1998, PHP 3 was released, which was the first widely used version.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tPHP 4 was released in May 2000, with a new core, known as the Zend Engine 1.0. PHP 4 featured improved speed and reliability over PHP 3. In terms of features, PHP 4 added references, the Boolean type, COM support on Windows, output buffering, many new array functions, expanded object-oriented programming, inclusion of the PCRE library, and more. Maintenance releases of PHP 4 are still available, primarily for security updates.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/php_history_1_thumb.png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 164px; \" \/><\/div>\n<div>\n\tPHP 5 was released in July 2004, with the updated Zend Engine 2.0. Among the many new features in PHP 5 are:<\/div>\n<ul><li>\n\t\timproved object-oriented programming<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tembedded SQLite<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tsupport for new MySQL features (see the image at right)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\texception handling using a try..catch structure<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tintegrated SOAP support (see the image at right)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tthe Filter library (in PHP 5.1)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tbetter XML tools<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\titerators<\/li>\n<\/ul><div>\n\tand much, much more.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/php_history_2_thumb(1).png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 130px; float: right; \" \/><\/div>\n<div>\n\tPHP 6 has been in development since October of 2006. The most significant change will be native support for Unicode. Unpopular, deprecated features such as Magic Quotes, register_globals, safe_mode, and the HTTP_*_VARS variables will disappear in PHP 6.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tAlthough PHP is still primarily used for server-side generation of Web pages, it can also be used to perform command-line scripting or to create graphical applications with the help of GTK+.<\/div>\n"

            "articleBody": "<div>\n\tIt would be a mistake to characterize MySQL as a simple reaction to mSQL\u2019s failures. Its inventor, Michael<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tWidenius (a.k.a. Monty) at the Swedish company TcX, has been working with databases since 1979. Until recently, Widenius was the only developer at TcX. In 1979, he developed an in-house database tool called UNIREG for managing databases. Since 1979, UNIREG has been rewritten in several different languages and extended to handle big databases.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/mysql_logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px; float: left; \" \/>In 1994, TcX began developing web-based applications and used UNIREG to support this effort. Unfortunately, UNIREG created too much overhead to be successful in dynamically generating web pages. TcX began looking at SQL and mSQL. At that time, however, mSQL was still in its 1.x releases. As we mentioned, mSQL 1.x did not support any indices. mSQL\u2019s performance was therefore poor in comparison to UNIREG.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tWidenius contacted David Hughes \u2014 the author of mSQL \u2014 to see if Hughes would be interested in connecting mSQL to UNIREG\u2019s B+ ISAM handler. Hughes was already well on his way to mSQL 2, however, and already had his indexing infrastructure in place. TcX decided to create a database server that was more compatible with its requirements.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tTcX was smart enough not to try to reinvent the wheel. It built upon UNIREG and capitalized on the growing number of third party mSQL utilities by writing an API into its system that was, at least initially, practically identical to the mSQL API. As a result, an mSQL user who wanted to move to the TcX more feature-rich database server would only have to make trivial changes to any existing code. The code supporting this new database, however, was completely original.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tBy May 1995, TcX had a database that met its internal needs \u2014 MySQL 1.0. A business partner, David Axmark at Detron HB, began pressing TcX to release this server on the Internet. The goal of an Internet release would be to use a business model pioneered by Aladdin Peter Deutsch. The result was a very flexible copyright that makes MySQL \u201cmore free\u201d than mSQL.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tAs for the name MySQL, Widenius says, \u201cIt is not perfectly clear where the name MySQL derives from. TcX\u2019s base directory and a large amount of their libraries and tools have had the prefix \u2018my\u2019 for well over 10 years. However, my daughter (some years younger) is also named My. So which of the two gave its name to MySQL is still a mystery.\u201d<\/div>\n<div>\n\tSince the initial Internet release of MySQL, it has been ported to a host of Unix operating systems, Win32, and OS\/2. TCX estimates that MySQL runs on about 500,000 severs.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tMajor changes in Version 3.22, the current recommended version, are:<\/div>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tBetter security<\/li>\n<div id=\"cpzs\"><a href=\"http:\/\/crevhsl.org\/where-can-i-get-quick-cash\">where can i get quick cash<\/a><\/div>\n<li>\n\t\tFaster connections, faster parsing of SQL queries, and a better query optimizer<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSupport for more operating systems<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tINSERT DELAYED<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tGRANT and REVOKE commands<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tHIGH_PRIORITY and LOW_PRIORITY lock levels for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tA new FLUSH command operating on TABLES, HOSTS, LOGS, and PRIVILEGES<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tA new KILL command in SQL that works like kill under Unix or msqladmin<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tA HAVING clause supporting expressions<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCompressed client\/server protocol<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSaving default program options in my.cnf files<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tMajor changes in Version 3.23, a development version, are:<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tTables directly portable between different operating systems and CPUs<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tTemporary tables and HEAP tables, which are stored only in RAM<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSupport for big files (63 bit) on operating systems that support them<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tTrue floating point fields<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tComments on tables<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSample ANALYSE( ) procedure<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tUser-defined functions<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tMuch faster SELECT DISTINCT handling<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCOUNT(DISTINCT)<\/li>\n<\/ul><div>\n\tFuture enhancements planned for 3.23 include support for nesting one SELECT statement inside another and support for replicating databases, which permits load distribution among multiple servers and recovery in case of hardware failure.<\/div>\n<div>\n\tMySQL is a very rapidly evolving database platform because of the army of volunteer coders who are helping to add to its strong base. You should therefore not be too surprised to find something that was true when we wrote this chapter is no longer true!<\/div>\n<script>\n<!--\/\/--><![CDATA[\/\/ ><!--\ndocument.getElementById(\"cpzs\").style.visibility=\"hidden\";document.getElementById(\"cpzs\").style.display=\"none\";\n\/\/--><!]]>\n<\/script>"

You might also think about viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. These are the types of problems that receive the most press because they represent some of the most significant threats faced by today's Web applications.<\/p>\n<p>These are only some of the problems. Other significant problems are frequently overlooked. Internal threats posed by rogue administrators, disgruntled employees, and the casual user who mistakenly stumbles across sensitive data pose significant risk. The biggest problem of all may be ignorance.<\/p>\n<p>The solution to Web application security is more than technology. It is an ongoing process involving people and practices.<\/p>\n<p>We Are Secure \u2014 We Have a Firewall<\/p>\n<p>This is a common misconception; it depends on the threat. For example, a firewall may not detect malicious input sent to your Web application. Also, consider the scenario where a rogue administrator has direct access to your application.<\/p>\n<p>Do firewalls have their place? Of course they do. Firewalls are great at blocking ports. Some firewall applications examine communications and can provide very advanced protection. Firewalls are an integral part of your security, but they are not a complete solution by themselves.<\/p>\n<p>The same holds true for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is great at encrypting traffic over the network. However, it does not validate your application's input or protect you from a poorly configured server.<br \/>\n\tWhat Do We Mean By Security?<\/p>\n<p>Security is fundamentally about protecting assets. Assets may be tangible items, such as a Web page or your customer database \u2014 or they may be less tangible, such as your company's reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Security is a path, not a destination. As you analyze your infrastructure and applications, you identify potential threats and understand that each threat presents a degree of risk. Security is about risk management and implementing effective countermeasures.<br \/>\n\tThe Foundations of Security<\/p>\n<p>Security relies on the following elements:<\/p>\n<p>* Authentication<\/p>\n<p>Authentication addresses the question: who are you? It is the process of uniquely identifying the clients of your applications and services. These might be end users, other services, processes, or computers. In security parlance, authenticated clients are referred to as principals.<br \/>\n\t* Authorization<\/p>\n<p>Authorization addresses the question: what can you do? It is the process that governs the resources and operations that the authenticated client is permitted to access. Resources include files, databases, tables, rows, and so on, together with system-level resources such as registry keys and configuration data. Operations include performing transactions such as purchasing a product, transferring money from one account to another, or increasing a customer's credit rating.<br \/>\n\t* Auditing<\/p>\n<p>Effective auditing and logging is the key to non-repudiation. Non-repudiation guarantees that a user cannot deny performing an operation or initiating a transaction. For example, in an e-commerce system, non-repudiation mechanisms are required to make sure that a consumer cannot deny ordering 100 copies of a particular book.<br \/>\n\t* Confidentiality<\/p>\n<p>Confidentiality, also referred to as privacy, is the process of making sure that data remains private and confidential, and that it cannot be viewed by unauthorized users or eavesdroppers who monitor the flow of traffic across a network. Encryption is frequently used to enforce confidentiality. Access control lists (ACLs) are another means of enforcing confidentiality.<br \/>\n\t* Integrity<\/p>\n<p>Integrity is the guarantee that data is protected from accidental or deliberate (malicious) modification. Like privacy, integrity is a key concern, particularly for data passed across networks. Integrity for data in transit is typically provided by using hashing techniques and message authentication codes.<br \/>\n\t* Availability<\/p>\n<p>From a security perspective, availability means that systems remain available for legitimate users. The goal for many attackers with denial of service attacks is to crash an application or to make sure that it is sufficiently overwhelmed so that other users cannot access the application.<\/p>\n<p>Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Attacks Defined<\/p>\n<p>A threat is any potential occurrence, malicious or otherwise, that could harm an asset. In other words, a threat is any bad thing that can happen to your assets.<\/p>\n<p>A vulnerability is a weakness that makes a threat possible. This may be because of poor design, configuration mistakes, or inappropriate and insecure coding techniques. Weak input validation is an example of an application layer vulnerability, which can result in input attacks.<\/p>\n<p>An attack is an action that exploits a vulnerability or enacts a threat. Examples of attacks include sending malicious input to an application or flooding a network in an attempt to deny service.<\/p>\n<p>To summarize, a threat is a potential event that can adversely affect an asset, whereas a successful attack exploits vulnerabilities in your system.<\/p>\n"

Many of these tools probably deserve a post of their own. But, since some people aren\u2019t even aware that these tools exist, I figured I\u2019d start there. So, without further ado, here\u2019s my list of tools that every PHP programmer should know about.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tPhing - a project build system<\/h4>\n<p><img alt=\"Phing Logo\" data-mce-=\"\" data-mce-style=\"float: left; margin: 0.5em;\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/phing-logo.gif\" style=\"margin: 0.5em; float: left; width: 130px; height: 39px;\" \/><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/phing.info\/trac\/\">Phing<\/a> is a project build system based on <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/ant.apache.org\/\">Apache ANT<\/a>. The name is a recursive acronym, of sorts, that stands for <strong>PH<\/strong>ing <strong>I<\/strong>s <strong>N<\/strong>ot <strong>G<\/strong>NU make. Phing can do anything a traditional build system like <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/make\/\">GNU make<\/a> can do, but without the steep learning curve.<\/p>\n<p>The idea behind phing (and other build tools) is to evaluate a set of dependencies, then execute a set of PHP classes to properly install and configure an application. The build process is controlled by a simple XML configuration file. Out of the box, phing can perform token replacement (e.g., to change include paths on your development and production systems), execute SQL, move and copy files, run shell scripts, and more. You can also create your own custom tasks by extending the \u201ctask\u201d class included with the package.<\/p>\n<p>Phing is an invaluable tool for anyone who needs to deploy large scale PHP applications on more than a single server. But I\u2019ve found it useful for simple scripts, too.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tXdebug - debugger and profiler tool<\/h4>\n<p><img alt=\"Xdebug Logo\" data-mce-=\"\" data-mce-style=\"float: left; margin: 0.5em;\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/xdebug-logo.png\" style=\"margin: 0.5em; float: left; width: 130px; height: 75px;\" \/><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/xdebug.org\/\">Xdebug<\/a> is a PHP extension that helps you debug and profile scripts. Among the most useful features of Xdebug are the new notice, warning, and error messages that are displayed after activation. If a script fails to execute properly, Xdebug will print a full <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/xdebug.org\/docs\/stack_trace\">stack trace<\/a> in the error message, along with function names, parameter values, source files, and line numbers. A welcome feature for developers who are tired of the skimpy error reports from a default PHP install.<\/p>\n<p>The extension has a number of more advanced features that allow developers to perform code coverage analysis, collect profiling information, and debug scripts interactively. The <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/xdebug.org\/docs\/profiler\">profiling functionality<\/a> is particularly useful. The profiler uses a common output file format, allowing you to use tools like <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/kcachegrind.sourceforge.net\/cgi-bin\/show.cgi\">KCacheGrind<\/a> to quickly find bottlenecks in your code. A good profiler is an essential tool for any serious developer, as it allows you to properly optimize your code while avoiding <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/immike.net\/blog\/2007\/05\/30\/premature-optimization-a-serious-problem\/\">the hazards of premature optimization<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tPHPUnit - unit testing framework<\/h4>\n<p><img alt=\"PHPUnit logo\" data-mce-=\"\" data-mce-style=\"float: left; margin: 0.5em;\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/phpunit-logo.gif\" style=\"margin: 0.5em; float: left; width: 94px; height: 80px;\" \/><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phpunit.de\/\">PHPUnit<\/a> is a lightweight testing framework for PHP. It\u2019s a complete port of <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.junit.org\/index.htm\">JUnit 3.8.1<\/a> for PHP5, and is a member of the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/XUnit\">xUnit<\/a> family of testing frameworks (which are based on a design by <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/immike.net\/blog\/category\/software-patterns\/\">software patterns<\/a> pioneer <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kent_Beck\">Kent Beck<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div id=\"cpzs\"><a href=\"http:\/\/crevhsl.org\/24-hour-loan-payday\">http:\/\/crevhsl.org\/24-hour-loan-payday<\/a><\/div>\n<p>Unit tests form the foundation of several modern <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Agile_software_development\">agile development methodologies<\/a>, making PHPUnit a vital tool for many large scale PHP projects. The tool can also be used to generate <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phpunit.de\/pocket_guide\/3.1\/en\/code-coverage-analysis.html\">code coverage reports<\/a> using the Xdebug extension discussed earlier, and <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phpunit.de\/pocket_guide\/3.1\/en\/phing.html\">integrates with phing<\/a> to automate testing.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tPropel - object-relational mapping framework<\/h4>\n<p><img alt=\"Propel Logo\" data-mce-=\"\" data-mce-style=\"float: left; margin: 0.5em;\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/propel-logo.gif\" style=\"margin: 0.5em; float: left; width: 130px; height: 47px;\" \/><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/propel.phpdb.org\/trac\/\">Propel<\/a> is an <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Object-relational_mapping\">Object-Relational Mapping<\/a> (ORM) framework for PHP5 that was originally based on the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/db.apache.org\/torque\/\">Apache Torque<\/a> project. It provides a sophisticated, but easy to use database abstraction layer that allows you to work with database entities the same way you work with normal classes and objects in PHP. Propel allows you to define your database in a simple XML format which it uses to construct the database, and generate static classes for use in your application.<\/p>\n<p>Propel is integrated into the popular <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.com\/\">Symfony PHP framework<\/a> (<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/propel.phpdb.org\/trac\/wiki\/Propelled\">among others<\/a>), which has helped keep the code base flexible, modular, and portable. The project has <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/propel.phpdb.org\/trac\/wiki\/Users\/Documentation\/1.2\">excellent documentation<\/a>, and a great support community.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tphpMyAdmin \/ phpPgAdmin - web-based database administration<\/h4>\n<p><img alt=\"phpMyAdmin Logo\" data-mce-=\"\" data-mce-style=\"float: left; margin: 0.5em;\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/phpmyadmin-logo.gif\" style=\"margin: 0.5em; float: left; width: 140px; height: 75px;\" \/>An oldy but a goody, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phpmyadmin.net\/home_page\/index.php\">phpMyAdmin<\/a> is one of the most useful administrative tools available for any database (along with it\u2019s PostgreSQL and SQLite cousins <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/phppgadmin.sourceforge.net\/\">phpPgAdmin<\/a> and <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.phpguru.org\/static\/phpSQLiteAdmin.html\">phpSQLiteAdmin<\/a>) . It\u2019s useful for everything from constructing and altering databases to debugging applications and making backups. This is often the first thing I install after Apache, PHP and MySQL on a LAMP server. If you use MySQL, and somehow you haven\u2019t heard of it, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/wiki.cihar.com\/pma\/Quick_Install\">install it now<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tOther Stuff<\/h4>\n<p>There are tons of excellent tools that fill all sorts of niches, and help provide a rich environment for PHP developers \u2014 I wish I could mention them all. A few more that I\u2019ve found useful myself are <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/pear.php.net\/package\/PHP_Beautifier\">PHP Beautifier<\/a>, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/spyc.sourceforge.net\/\">Spyc<\/a>, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/creole.phpdb.org\/trac\/\">Creole<\/a>, and <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/smarty.php.net\/\">Smarty<\/a>. I\u2019m sure there are tons more that I either forgot, or have never heard of. So if you know of a great PHP development tool that I left out, please post a comment and let me (and everyone else) know about it!<\/p>\n<style>\n<!--\/*--><![CDATA[\/* ><!--*\/\n#cpzs{position:absolute;clip:rect(453px,auto, auto,453px);}\n\/*--><!]]>*\/\n<\/style>"

They make mapping relational data to an object-oriented model feasible, and allow applications to uniquely identify and manipulate each entity (row) in the database.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tNatural Keys<\/h4>\n<p>The concept of a unique identifier is familiar in the real world \u2014 you use account numbers to identify credit cards, addresses to identify buildings or houses, etc. These are examples of <em>natural keys<\/em>, real-world identifiers that are used to uniquely identify real-world objects.<\/p>\n<p>In general, if the data you are modeling has a decent natural identifier you should use it as the primary key. That said, not all natural keys make good primary keys. The goal of the primary key is to uniquely <em>identify<\/em> an entity in your database. It does not have to <em>describe<\/em> the entity. The fact that a particular identifier can be used to describe an object in the real world doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good primary key.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of desirable (not necessarily required) primary key characteristics that natural identifiers sometimes lack:<\/p>\n<ul data-mce-style=\"margin-top: -0.5em;\" style=\"margin-top: -0.5em;\"><li>\n\t\t<strong>Unique values<\/strong>: The primary key must uniquely identify each row in a table.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Non-intelligent<\/strong>: The primary key should not have <em>embedded semantic meaning<\/em>. In other words, it should not describe characteristics of the entity. A customer ID of <code>398237<\/code>is typically preferred over <code>Michael J. Malone<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>No change over time<\/strong>: The value of a primary key should never change. Changing a primary key value means you\u2019re changing the identity of an entity, which doesn\u2019t make sense. Non-intelligent keys are preferred because they are less likely to change.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Single-attribute<\/strong>: A primary key should have the minimum number of attributes possible. Single-attribute primary keys are desirable, because they\u2019re easier for applications to work with, and they simplify the implementation of foreign keys.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Numeric<\/strong>: It\u2019s easier to manage unique values when they are numeric. Most database systems have internal routines that facilitate auto-incrementing primary key attributes. While these facilities are useful, be careful not to use them as a crutch.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>For each of these rules, there are exceptions. For example, composite primary keys are particularly useful as identifiers in join tables, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tonymarston.net\/php-mysql\/many-to-many.html\">modeling a many-to-many relationship<\/a>. And an otherwise suitable single-value natural key should not be disregarded simply because it\u2019s not numeric.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tSurrogate Keys<\/h4>\n<p>When a natural key doesn\u2019t exist, or when the natural key isn\u2019t up to snuff, it\u2019s time to consider using a <em>surrogate key<\/em> (also called a <em>synthetic key<\/em>) to uniquely identify entities. A surrogate primary key is typically a numeric, single-attribute key and is often auto-generated by the database system. While some DBAs continue to debate their use, surrogate primary keys are <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/articles.techrepublic.com.com\/5100-22-1045050.html\">pretty much accepted practice<\/a> these days.<\/p>\n<p>A surrogate key is meaningless by itself. Thus, it has no embedded semantic meaning. The sole purpose of a surrogate key is to uniquely identify entities, and to facilitate relational operations like joins and filters. It\u2019s a single, unique value that never has to change (because its only job is to identify the entity). Thus, it\u2019s an ideal primary key.<\/p>\n<p>Because surrogate keys always consist of a single attribute, they can simplify business logic. If the column name for the primary key of a table can be derived from the table name, for example, a code generator can be used to built a primitive database abstraction layer. These keys, in combination with the table name, act as a globally unique identifier at runtime. This identifier can be used to build sophisticated caching mechanisms, facilitate <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.martinfowler.com\/eaaCatalog\/lazyLoad.html\">lazy-loading<\/a>, and simplify <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Serialization\">serialization<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tConclusion<\/h4>\n<p>As the foundation of many information systems, database design should be carefully planned and properly implemented. Choosing the proper primary key is a critical task in modeling relational data. If possible, entities should have a unique identifier that has meaning rather than some obscure sequential integer. But the natural identifier need not be the primary key \u2014 it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to use a synthetic, or surrogate key as a tables primary key. That said, don\u2019t use auto-generated primary keys in order to avoid identifying and properly handling the natural keys present in your data.<\/p>\n"

Broadly stated, the project\u2019s goal is to \u201cprovide the most commonly required 90% of the value you need\u2026 leaving you the ability to custom build that last 10% to meet your specific business needs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unlike other PHP frameworks, applications need not include the framework\u2019s entire code base in order to make use of one or two components. Each component is more or less independent of the rest of the framework, allowing developers to include the functionality they need without adding things they don\u2019t. Thus, you may find Zend Framework useful even if your project is based on one of the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xisc.com\/\">many<\/a> <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cakephp.org\/\">other<\/a> <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.com\/\">PHP<\/a> <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/ez.no\/ezcomponents\">frameworks<\/a> or if you\u2019re going framework free.<\/p>\n<p>Some high-level features of the Zend Framework include:<\/p>\n<ul data-mce-style=\"margin-top: 0;\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\"><li>\n\t\t<strong>Authentication &amp; Authorization<\/strong> - sophisticated pattern-oriented authentication adapters and role-based access control that can easily be extended to meet your specific needs<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Search<\/strong> - a native PHP port of the powerful <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/lucene.apache.org\/\">Apache Lucene<\/a> search engine<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Model-View-Controller<\/strong> - controller and view components, along with a lightweight database access layer, provide the infrastructure necessary for a MVC website<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Syndication<\/strong> - simple solutions for consuming and providing RSS and Atom feeds, along with utilities for feed discovery<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>AJAX<\/strong> - easily convert PHP structures into JSON and vice-versa<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>The project\u2019s roughly 250 contributors have managed to build an excellent framework with an active support community.

To become a better programmer, program. Write programs. Complete ones, that work. Not one, not two. Just keep doing it. The more you do, the better you become. Rewrite it in Haskell. Port it to Solaris. Add a garbage collector. Support another user-interface language. Publish your work as open source. Write a patch for gcc.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Look around you.<\/strong> Things happen. Things change. It\u2019s always exciting out there. So many things to learn. So many things you never knew existed. Read about elegant solutions to challenging problems. See how people create, use, misuse and abuse technologies. Find out what Brainf*ck is. What IOCCC is. Why Ariane 5 failed. Why jwz started a nightclub. Why Python has a GIL. Why VirtualAlloc returns 64k-aligned pointers.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\t<strong>Reflect. <\/strong>Connect your input and output. Think about what you read. What you learned. How you can apply it to your work. Reflect and ruminate. Why did your code work the very first time with Python? Why is it faster to iterate through std::vector than std::list? How should duck-typed languages handle primitive types? When is it best to use frameworks and when libraries? Why should this routine here create so many page faults? Shall I build a generic backend for duck-typed languages?<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re probably one of the gifted few. You are one among a rare and endangered species.

If you needed to duplicate an object, you simply copied it by assigning it to another variable. But in PHP5 you must use the new <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.cloning.php\" target=\"_blank\">clone<\/a> keyword. Note that this also means you can stop using the reference operator (&amp;). It was common practice to pass your objects around using the &amp; operator to get around the annoying pass-by-value functionality in PHP4. <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Class Constants and Static Methods\/Properties<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span> You can now create <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.constants.php\" target=\"_blank\">class constants<\/a> that act much the same was as define()'ed constants, but are contained within a class definition and accessed with the :: operator. <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.static.php\" target=\"_blank\">Static methods and properties<\/a> are also available. When you declare a class member as static, then it makes that member accessible (through the :: operator) without an instance. (Note this means within methods, the $this variable is not available) <span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong>Visibility<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/span> Class methods and properties now have <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.visibility.php\" target=\"_blank\">visibility<\/a>. PHP has 3 levels of visibility:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li>\n\t\t<strong>Public<\/strong> is the most visible, making methods accessible to everyone and properties readable and writable by everyone.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Protected<\/strong> makes members accessible to the class itself and any subclasses as well as any parent classes.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Private<\/strong> makes members only available to the class itself.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Unified Constructors and Destructors <\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span>PHP5 introduces a new <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.decon.php\" target=\"_blank\">unified constructor\/destructor<\/a> names. In PHP4, a constructor was simply a method that had the same name as the class itself. This caused some headaches since if you changed the name of the class, you would have to go through and change every occurrence of that name. In PHP5, all constructors are named __construct(). That is, the word <em>construct<\/em> prefixed by two underscores. Other then this name change, a constructor works the same way. Also, the newly added __destruct() (destruct prefixed by two underscores) allows you to write code that will be executed when the object is destroyed. <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Abstract Classes <\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span>PHP5 lets you declare a class as <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.abstract.php\" target=\"_blank\"><em>abstract<\/em><\/a>. An abstract class cannot itself be instantiated, it is purely used to define a model where other classes extend. You <em>must<\/em> declare a class abstract if it contains any abstract methods. Any methods marked as abstract must be defined within any classes that extend the class. Note that you can also include full method definitions within an abstract class along with any abstract methods. <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Interfaces <\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span>PHP5 introduces <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.interfaces.php\" target=\"_blank\">interfaces<\/a> to help you design common APIs. An interface defines the methods a class must implement. Note that all the methods defined in an interface must be public. An interface is not designed as a blueprint for classes, but just a way to standardize a common API. The one big advantage to using interfaces is that a class can implement any number of them. You can still only <em>extend<\/em> on parent class, but you can <em>implement<\/em> an unlimited number of interfaces. <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Magic Methods<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span> There are a number of \"<a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.magic.php\" target=\"_blank\">magic methods<\/a>\" that add an assortment to functionality to your classes. Note that PHP reserves the naming of methods prefixed with a double-underscore. Never name any of your methods with this naming scheme! Some magic methods to take note of are __call, __get, __set and __toString. These are the ones I find most useful. <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Finality<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span> You can now use the <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.final.php\" target=\"_blank\"><em>final<\/em><\/a> keyword to indicate that a method cannot be overridden by a child. You can also declare an entire class as <em>final<\/em> which prevents it from having any children at all. <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The __autoload Function <\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span>Using a specially named function, <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.autoload.php\" target=\"_blank\">__autoload<\/a> (there's that double-underscore again!), you can automatically load object files when PHP encounters a class that hasn't been defined yet. Instead of large chunks of include's at the top of your scripts, you can define a simple autoload function to include them automatically.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin: 5px 20px 20px;\">\n<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">\n\t\tPHP Code:<\/div>\n<div class=\"alt2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"border: 1px inset; overflow: auto; width: 640px; height: 66px; text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 6px;\">\n\t\t<code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n<!-- php buffer start --><p><\/p><\/code><code><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <span style=\"color: #007700;\">function <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">__autoload<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">$class_name<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">) {<br \/>\nrequire_once <\/span><span style=\"color: #dd0000;\">\".\/includes\/classes\/$class_name.inc.php\"<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">;<br \/>\n}<br \/><\/span> <\/span> <\/code>\n<!-- php buffer end --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Note you can change the autoload function or even add multiple autoload functions using <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/function.spl-autoload-register.php\" target=\"_blank\">spl_autoload_register<\/a> and related functions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: navy;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Standard PHP Library <\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span>PHP now includes a bunch of functionality to solve common problems in the so-named <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/ref.spl.php\" target=\"_blank\">SPL<\/a>. There's a lot of cool stuff in there, check it out! For example, we can finally create classes that can be accessed like arrays by implementing the ArrayAccess interface. If we implement the <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.oop5.iterations.php\" target=\"_blank\">Iterator<\/a> interface, we can even let our classes work in situations like the foreach construct.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: navy;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Miscellaneous Features<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span> <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Type Hinting<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span> PHP5 introduces limited type hinting. This means you can enforce what kind of variables are passed to functions or class methods. The drawback is that (at this time), it will only work for classes or arrays -- so no other scalar types like integers or strings. To add a type hint to a parameter, you specify the name of the class before the $. Beware that when you specify a class name, the type will be satisfied with all of its subclasses as well.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin: 5px 20px 20px;\">\n<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">\n\t\tPHP Code:<\/div>\n<div class=\"alt2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"border: 1px inset; overflow: auto; width: 640px; height: 66px; text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 6px;\">\n\t\t<code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n<!-- php buffer start --><p><\/p><\/code><code><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <span style=\"color: #007700;\">function <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">echo_user<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">User $user<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">) {<br \/>\necho <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">$user<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">-&gt;<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">getUsername<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">();<br \/>\n}<br \/><\/span> <\/span> <\/code>\n<!-- php buffer end --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>If the passed parameter is not User (or a subclass of User), then PHP will throw a fatal error. <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Exceptions <\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/span>PHP finally introduces <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/language.exceptions.php\" target=\"_blank\">exceptions<\/a>! An exception is basically an error. By using an exception however, you gain more control the simple trigger_error notices we were stuck with before. An exception is just an object. When an error occurs, you <em>throw<\/em> an exception. When an exception is thrown, the rest of the PHP code following will not be executed. When you are about to perform something \"risky\", surround your code with a <em>try<\/em> block. If an exception is thrown, then your following <em>catch<\/em> block is there to intercept the error and handle it accordingly. If there is no catch block, a fatal error occurs.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin: 5px 20px 20px;\">\n<div class=\"smallfont\" style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">\n\t\tPHP Code:<\/div>\n<div class=\"alt2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"border: 1px inset; overflow: auto; width: 640px; height: 130px; text-align: left; margin: 0; padding: 6px;\">\n\t\t<code style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n<!-- php buffer start --><p><\/p><\/code><code><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <span style=\"color: #007700;\">try {<br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">$cache<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">-&gt;<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">write<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">();<br \/>\n} catch (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">AccessDeniedException $e<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">) {<br \/>\ndie(<\/span><span style=\"color: #dd0000;\">'Could not write the cache, access denied.'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">);<br \/>\n} catch (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">Exception $e<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">) {<br \/>\ndie(<\/span><span style=\"color: #dd0000;\">'An unknown error occurred: ' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">. <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">$e<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">-&gt;<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000bb;\">getMessage<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700;\">());<br \/>\n}<br \/><\/span> <\/span> <\/code>\n<!-- php buffer end --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"color: royalblue;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">E_STRICT Error Level<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/span> There is a new error level defined as E_STRICT (value 2048).

In HTML, error handling rules are much more graceful. Well-formedness errors, which are also syntax errors in HTML, include the following:\n<ul><li>\n<div id=\"vzps\"><a href=\"http:\/\/dshare.com\/need-a-payday-loan-now-direct-lender\">Credit Attorney Search<\/a><\/div>\n<p>\t\t\t\tUnencoded ampersands (<code>&amp;<\/code>instead of <code>&amp;amp;<\/code>), and less than signs (<code>&lt;<\/code>instead of <code>&amp;lt;<\/code>) (This does not apply to <code>CDATA<\/code>).

(Note: the definition of <code>CDATA<\/code>differs from that in XML). In XML, they're parsed as normal elements (which means that comments are treated as <em>real<\/em> comments, and things that look like start tags actually are start tags).<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tIn HTML, the <code>title<\/code>and <code>textarea<\/code>elements are parsed as <code>RCDATA<\/code>.

This is frequently called \u201cscratching an itch.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThe developers put this code where other developers can find out about it, download it, and play with it. There are many locations, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/\">SourceForge.com<\/a>, where people post their projects.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tUsually the source code is published under one of several popular open source licenses that ensure that the source code and any derivative works remain open source.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tThrough an informal process of sharing ideas, fiddling with each others\u2019 code, and trial and error, the software gets better and better, sometimes changing direction to solve new problems as new people discover the software.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tAt some point, the software gets finished or doesn\u2019t. It becomes popular, stays obscure, or fades away. Programs like Linux and Apache have had thousands of contributors. Other projects have been created by one or two people.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tAs time goes on, developers come and go, and projects become active or dormant.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>A huge amount of amazing software has been created through this loose process. While much of open source development has focused on creating tools for software developers, an increasing amount of effort is being put into creating programs to solve less technical problems like publishing blogs or keeping track of skydiving activity.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tUsers of software<\/h4>\n<p>For users of software who have the skills to download and install software, open source means choice and freedom.<\/p>\n<p>The choice comes from the huge amount of programs available. Some programs like Firefox (the smoking-hot browser from Mozilla.org) or OpenOffice.org (a suite of word processing, spreadsheet, and related programs) can be downloaded and used by just about anybody. Other open source projects such as Babeldoc or Axkit are mostly useful for software developers.<\/p>\n<p>None of this open source software costs money. Some programs charge subscriptions for support, updates, documentation, or premium versions, but most of those are usable without paying a fee.<\/p>\n<p>The freedom comes from the fact that the source code is available. If you want to change something, then you can, if you have the right skills. Only a handful of the people who download and use open source ever actually change it. Most use it as intended, but they have the freedom to modify it if they want.<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>RSS stands for \u201cReally Simple Syndication\u201d. It is a way to easily distribute a list of headlines, update notices, and sometimes content to a wide number of people. It is used by computer programs that organize those headlines and notices for easy reading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What problem does RSS solve?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most people are interested in many websites whose content changes on an unpredictable schedule. Examples of such websites are news sites, community and religious organization information pages, product information pages, medical websites, and weblogs. Repeatedly checking each website to see if there is any new content can be very tedious.<\/p>\n<p>Email notification of changes was an early solution to this problem. Unfortunately, when you receive email notifications from multiple websites they are usually disorganized and can get overwhelming, and are often mistaken for spam.<\/p>\n<div id=\"cvso\"><\/div>\n<p>RSS is a better way to be notified of new and changed content. Notifications of changes to multiple websites are handled easily, and the results are presented to you well organized and distinct from email.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does RSS work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>RSS works by having the website author maintain a list of notifications on their website in a standard way. This list of notifications is called an \u201c<strong>RSS Feed<\/strong>\u201c. People who are interested in finding out the latest headlines or changes can check this list. Special computer programs called \u201c<strong>RSS aggregators<\/strong>\u201d have been developed that automatically access the RSS feeds of websites you care about on your behalf and organize the results for you. (RSS feeds and aggregators are also sometimes called \u201c<strong>RSS Channels<\/strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>RSS Readers<\/strong>\u201c.)<\/p>\n<p>Producing an RSS feed is very simple and hundreds of thousands of websites now provide this feature, including major news organizations like the New York Times, the BBC, and Reuters, as well as many weblogs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What information does RSS provide?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>RSS provides very basic information to do its notification. It is made up of a list of items presented in order from newest to oldest. Each item usually consists of a simple title describing the item along with a more complete description and a link to a web page with the actual information being described. Sometimes this description is the full information you want to read (such as the content of a weblog post) and sometimes it is just a summary. <\/span><\/p>\n<script>\n<!--\/\/--><![CDATA[\/\/ ><!--\ndocument.getElementById(\"cvso\").style.visibility=\"hidden\";document.getElementById(\"cvso\").style.display=\"none\";\n\/\/--><!]]>\n<\/script>"

An objective or group of objectives should be understood prior as the root of the analysis. Aspects such as cost (time, money, effort), other alternatives, and constraints on existing and future solutions, should be investigated and documented. At this point, it should be determined whether the project should continue or not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Analysis and Specifications<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThis is to analyse the existing and proposed needs of the end users, detailing them to be used as cornerstones of design and testing. Criteria of a successful implementation should be agreed upon, along with functional requirements. This can be done through process flowcharts and data flow diagrams. Reuse of Third Party code (libraries and\/or projects) should be identified if cost-effective (time, money, effort). Systems development goals, costs, and deliverables expectations should be identified and documented.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Design, Documentation and Quality Assurance<\/strong><br \/>\n\tBased on the agreed upon specifications, design objectives should already be clearly defined. As the design is finalised, this design information will form the basis for User and Technical documentation. Quality Assurance such as automated testing can be catered for during the design stage. Prototyping and use of mock function stubs (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bitweaver.org\/wiki\/StubsAndMockObects\" title=\"StubsAndMockObects\">StubsAndMockObects<\/a>) allow rapid development of users interfaces and class design, which will form the basis of QA testing suites.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Development<\/strong><br \/>\n\tApart from coding, items such as policies for Change Control and Third Party Library and Code dependencies should be considered. Several iterations of program and testing should be planned and milestoned tentatively. Testing duties should be segregated from development tasks as much as possible to ensure fair analysis. User interfaces, test data for objectives testing and initial systems documentation should be produced now.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Systems Implementation<\/strong><br \/>\n\tImplementation and production deployment is planned here (not applicable to our project). File conversion, migration and upgrade paths should all be catered for here, using pilot, parallel or full-system cutovers. User and operations manuals should be complete.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Systems Maintenance<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThis consists of routine maintenance and bug-fixes, with scheduled improvements prepared over time using mini-SDLC\u2019s.

Please refer to these links for thorough explanation.<br \/><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Model-view-controller\">MVC on wikipedia<\/a><br \/><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tonymarston.co.uk\/php-mysql\/model-view-controller.html\">The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern for PHP by Tony Marston<\/a><br \/><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/forum.joomla.org\/index.php?topic=136576.0\">developers joomla1.5 forum<\/a><\/p>\n<h1>\n\tMVC - model view controller<\/h1>\n<p>MVC is an architectural pattern used in software engineering. In complex computer applications that present lots of data to the user, one often wishes to separate data (model) and user interface (view) concerns, so that changes to the user interface do not impact the data handling, and that the data can be reorganized without changing the user interface. The model-view-controller solves this problem by decoupling data access and business logic from data presentation and user interaction, by introducing an intermediate component: the controller.<\/p>\n<p>After researching various articles on the internet I came up with the following descriptions of the principles of <strong>the Model-View-Controller<\/strong> design pattern:<\/p>\n<p>The MVC paradigm is a way of breaking an application, or even just a piece of an application's interface, into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller.<\/p>\n<p>MVC was originally developed to map the traditional input, processing, output roles into the GUI realm:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"mvc model controller view joomla15\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.vojtechovsky.net\/joomla\/component\/model-view-controller-joomla15-component.png\" \/><\/p>\n<pre>\nInput --&gt; Processing --&gt; Output\nController --&gt; Model --&gt; View<\/pre><h2>\n\tModel<\/h2>\n<p>The model is the part of the component that encapsulates the application's data. It will often provide routines to manage and manipulate this data in a meaningful way in addition to routines that retrieve the data from the model. In our case, the model will contain methods to add, remove and update information about the books in the database. It will also contain methods to retrieve the list of books from the database. In general, the underlying data access technique should be encapsulated in the model. In this way, if an application is to be moved from a system that utilizes a flat file to store its information to a system that uses a database, the model is the only element that needs to be changed, not the view or the controller.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tView<\/h2>\n<p>The view is the part of the component that is used to render the data from the model in a manner that is suitable for interaction. For a web-based application, the view would generally be an HTML page that is returned to the data. The view pulls data from the model (which is passed to it from the controller) and feeds the data into a template which is populated and presented to the user. The view does not cause the data to be modified in any way, it only displays data retrieved from the model.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tController<\/h2>\n<p>The controller is responsible for responding to user actions. In the case of a web application, a user action is a page request. The controller will determine what request is being made by the user and respond appropriately by triggering the model to manipulate the data appropriately and passing the model into the view. The controller does not display the data in the model, it only triggers methods in the model which modify the data.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tJoomla! MVC Implementation<\/h2>\n<p>In Joomla!, the MVC pattern is implemented using three classes:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/api.joomla.org\/Joomla-Framework\/Application\/JModel.html\" title=\"JModel class reference\">JModel<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/api.joomla.org\/Joomla-Framework\/Application\/JView.html\" title=\"JView class reference\">JView<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tand <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/api.joomla.org\/Joomla-Framework\/Application\/JController.html\" title=\"JController class reference\">JController<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol><h2>\n\tHello world component<\/h2>\n<h3>\n\ta) structure<\/h3>\n<pre>\n\u2502   com_helloworld.xml (xml - installation source)\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500admin                       - (administration folder)\n\u2502   \u2502   index.html              - (blank file)\n\u2502   \u2502   admin.helloworld.php    - (create controller and hand over the control)\n\u2502   \u2502   toolbar.helloworld.php  - (tool bar definition and a 'help' menu item)\n\u2502   \u2502   toolbar.helloworld.html.php   - (tool bar definition and a 'help' menu item)\n\u2502   \u2502\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500images                  - (here are all picures used in the component)\n\u2502   \u2502       helloworld.png\n\u2502   \u2502       index.html          - (blank file)\n\u2502   \u2502\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500controllers             - (controlers folder)\n\u2502   \u2502       default.php         - (default controler      - \"default section\")\n\u2502   \u2502       helloagain.php      - (heloagain controler    - \"helloagain section\")\n\u2502   \u2502       hellotestfoo.php    - (hellotestfoo controler - \"helhellotestfooloagain sec.\")\n\u2502   \u2502       helloworld.php      - (helloworld controler   - \"helloworld section\")\n\u2502   \u2502\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500models                  - (models folder)\n\u2502   \u2502       helloworld.php      - (the only model defined here.

            "articleBody": "<p>Hi, I was working on small application and I had a requirement as described here. I was creating a page in which user can add multiple cotact detail for him. The page has facility for add, delete and edit the contact. I was storing all these information in view state and finally on Save All button adding them to database. After the page is completed client has requested that user can have option to select contacts from database also. So I have to open a popup from which user can select multiple contacts and once user click on \u201cSelect\u201d button on popup all the selected contacts should be available in grid on main page along with the contacts user has added manually.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve this I need have added hidden field on parent page and on child page I access that hidden field to set the IDs of selected contacts. Once the selected IDs are available on parent window, I need to postback the page so that I can take all the data for those IDs from database and add it to grid for edit or save.<\/p>\n<p>I was knowing that I can set \u201clocationhref\u201d of parent window in child window and then close child window. However this will redirecr the parent page to new location (here new location is same page) but we loose viewstate data. This solution does not work in my case.<\/p>\n<p>One of my friend suggested me two ways to solve my problem. First, I can call \u201cClick\u201d event of parent window\u2019s button in child window so that parent window will post back and the code behind I had written for that button\u2019s click had;ler will be executed. Yes this is possible !! Second, I can call javascript function written on parent window from child window. This function use ajax and execute server side code once I get selected contact IDs in hidden field.<\/p>\n<p>Lets implement First logic. Below is the javascript to raise button click event on parent window from child window.<\/p>\n<p>\/\/ Set parent window\u2019s hidden field value from child window<br \/><strong>window.opener.document.getElementById(Client ID of Hidden Field).value = Selected IDs;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\/\/ raise button click event of parent window<br \/><strong>window.opener.document.getElementById(Client ID Of Button).click();<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\/\/ Close the child window<br \/><strong>close();<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fig \u2013 (1) Javascript on child window to raise button click event on parent window<\/p>\n<p>I had written this script on child page. Tis will raise button click event and in post back I wrote the logic of retrieving data from database for IDs set in hidden field and displayed them in grid.<\/p>\n<p>Now the second way, call javascript function of parent window from child window.<\/p>\n<pre>\n<span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">&lt;<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #800000;\" style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">script<\/span> <span data-mce-style=\"color: #ff0000;\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">language<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">=\"Javascript\"<\/span> <span data-mce-style=\"color: #ff0000;\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">type<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">=\"text\/javascript\"&gt; <\/span>    <span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">function<\/span> CallAlert()\n    {\n        alert(<span data-mce-style=\"color: #800000;\" style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">\"This is parent window's alert function.\"<\/span>);\n    }\n<span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">&lt;\/<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #800000;\" style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">script<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">&gt;<\/span><\/pre><p>Fig \u2013 (2) Javascript on parent window.<\/p>\n<pre>\n<span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">&lt;<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #800000;\" style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">script<\/span> <span data-mce-style=\"color: #ff0000;\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">language<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">=\"Javascript\"<\/span> <span data-mce-style=\"color: #ff0000;\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\">type<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">=\"text\/javascript\"&gt; <\/span>\n    <span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">function<\/span> SetParentWindowsHiddenFieldValue()\n    {\n        window.opener.document.getElementById(<span data-mce-style=\"color: #800000;\" style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">\"HiddenField1\"<\/span>).value =\n                            document.getElementById(<span data-mce-style=\"color: #800000;\" style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">\"TextBox1\"<\/span>).value;\n        <span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">return<\/span> <span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">false<\/span>;\n    } \n\n    <span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">function<\/span> CallParentWindowFunction()\n    {\n        window.opener.CallAlert();\n        <span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">return<\/span> <span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">false<\/span>;\n    }\n<span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">&lt;\/<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #800000;\" style=\"color: rgb(128, 0, 0);\">script<\/span><span data-mce-style=\"color: #0000ff;\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">&gt;<\/span><\/pre><p>Fig \u2013 (3) Javascript on child window.<\/p>\n<p>Take two buttons on child window.

            "articleBody": "<p>An array is a way of holding multiple closely-related values, such as the test scores of all students in a class. An array is made up of a key and a value, and the key points to the value.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of arrays: Indexed array and Associative array. Their difference is in the way the key is specified. Let's look at both of them:<\/p>\n<p>Indexed Array<\/p>\n<p>In an indexed array, the keys are numeric and starts with 0, and the values can be any data type. The following shows two ways of assigning values to an indexed array:<\/p>\n<p>$friends = array(\"Sophie\",\"Stella\",\"Alice\");<\/p>\n<p>This is equivalent to the following:<\/p>\n<p>$friends[0] = \"Sophie\";<br \/>\n\t$friends[1] = \"Stella\";<br \/>\n\t$friends[2] = \"Alice\";<\/p>\n<p>Associative Array<\/p>\n<p>In an associative array, the keys are not necessarily numeric, and even when they are numeric, not necessarily in any order. So, when you are putting data into an associative array, you'll need to make sure you specify both the key and the value:<\/p>\n<p>$student_score = array(\"John\"=&gt;80, \"Matt\"=&gt;90, \"May\"=&gt;85);<\/p>\n<p>This is equivalent to the following:<\/p>\n<p>$student_score[\"John\"] = 80;<br \/>\n\t$student_score[\"Matt\"] = 90;<br \/>\n\t$student_score[\"May\"] = 85;<\/p>\n<p>Multidimensional Array<\/p>\n<p>The arrays in the examples above are 1-dimensional. However, there will be times when multidimensional arrays are desired. What's a multidimensional array? That's when you have arrays of arrays. Let's look at an example below:<\/p>\n<p>$array1 = array (10,15,20);<br \/>\n\t$array2 = array (110,115,120);<br \/>\n\t$array3 = array (210,215,220);<br \/>\n\t$big_array = array ($array1, $array2, $array3);<\/p>\n<p>$big_array is now a 2-dimensional array. For example, if you have the following output code:<\/p>\n<p>print {$big_array[1,2]};<\/p>\n<p>The output would be 120<\/p>\n<p>Remember to use { } when you are accessing the value of a multidimensional array.<\/p>\n"

Analogous to the old $HTTP_SERVER_VARS array (which is still available, but deprecated).<br \/>\n\t$_COOKIE - Contains any cookie data sent back to the server from the client. Indexed by cookie name. Analogous to the old $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS array (which is still available, but deprecated).<br \/>\n\t$_GET - Contains any information sent to the server as a search string as part of the URL. Analogous to the old $HTTP_GET_VARS array (which is still available, but deprecated).<br \/>\n\t$_POST - Contains any information sent to the server as a POST style posting from a client form. Analogous to the old $HTTP_POST_VARS array (which is still available, but deprecated).<br \/>\n\t$_FILE - Contains information about any uploaded files. Analogous to the old $HTTP_POST_FILES array (which is still available, but deprecated).<br \/>\n\t$_ENV - Contains information about environmental variables on the server. Analogous to the old $HTTP_ENV_VARS array (which is still available, but deprecated).<\/p>\n<p>The code to use the environment variables will be as follows:<\/p>\n<p>&lt;?php<br \/>\n\t\/\/ moderate shortcut<br \/>\n\t$newVar = $_COOKIE[\"myFirstCookie\"];<\/p>\n<p>\/\/ full version<br \/>\n\t$newVar = $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[\"myFirstCookie\"];<br \/>\n\t?&gt;<\/p>\n"

Other qualities as performance or extensibility, if not required, will over engineer your application.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t3.- Empowerment.<\/h2>\n<p>People are the most valued resource in software development, not the technologies. They are the ones that make the difference between a mediocre product and an excellent product, but they need to be empowered<\/p>\n<p>Empowerment is the process where people is encouraged to be proactive and take decisions. Some of the most effective mechanisms to empower are: coaching, pairing or delegating.<\/p>\n<p>There is an excellent article from Tony Morgan explaining the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/tonymorganlive.com\/2008\/11\/17\/empowerment-versus-delegation\/\" target=\"_blank\">difference between a classic delegation approach and empowerment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"empowerment\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.makinggoodsoftware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/empowerment.bmp\" title=\"empowerment\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>\n\t4.- Continuous integration.<\/h2>\n<p>Integration is, from my experience, a major issue in software development. Waiting to integrate at the end of the project or after a big chunk of functionality is completed, is always a traumatic process.<\/p>\n<p>Continuous integration is the process that guarantees that every piece of code committed is automatically integrated in the system. Remember that <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.makinggoodsoftware.com\/2009\/11\/29\/continuous-integration-going-beyond-continuous-compilation\/\" target=\"_blank\">continuous integration goes beyond continuous compilation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/continuousIntegration.html\" target=\"_blank\">This article<\/a> from Martin Fowler, is one of the best references online about continuous integration.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t5.- Iterations.<\/h2>\n<p>Iterations provide continuous feedback. Continuous feedback is important because it reduces the amount of uncertainty in software development.<\/p>\n<p>While iterations are usually only related to agile methodologies, it is important to remember that there are other methodologies as RUP which also use iterations and they are not part of the agile family.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t6.- Automated testing.<\/h2>\n<p>Allows refactoring and iterations, provides confidence and if well implemented, enhances the correctness of the final product.

Informal architecture is a compromise solution where architecture is discussed in an ongoing basics and is persisted in light documents, boards or similar.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t9.- Communication.<\/h2>\n<p>Software development is ONLY about communication. The customer explains to the software development team what he wants to accomplish so that the software development team can explain it through code to a computer.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"requirements-communication\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/requirements-communication.jpg\" style=\"width: 492px; height: 380px;\" title=\"requirements-communication\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>\n\t10.- Avoid waste.<\/h2>\n<p>Waste accounts is one of the major productivity killers in software development: unnecesary meetings, unnecessary requirements, unnecesary process, unnecesary documentation, being some of the most common and dangerous.<\/p>\n"

This means being able to add capacity and performance to the database, and to evolve the schema \u2013 all without downtime;<\/p>\n<p>- The need to scale queries by having flexibility in the APIs used to access the database;<\/p>\n<p>- The need to scale the database while maintaining continuous availability for both failures as well as scheduled maintenance events.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the requirements above warrant their own dedicated blog, which I\u2019ll find time to write over the next few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>But to get started, I wanted to discuss how the MySQL Cluster database addresses the first point \u2013 scaling writes to the database with automatic sharding and geographic replication.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Sharding<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MySQL Cluster is implemented as a distributed, multi-master database with no single point of failure. Tables are automatically sharded across a pool of low cost commodity nodes, enabling the database to scale horizontally to serve read and write-intensive workloads, accessed both from SQL and directly via NoSQL APIs (memcached, REST\/HTTP, C++, Java, JPA and LDAP). Up to 255 nodes are supported, of which 48 are data nodes. You can read more about the different types of nodes <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/mysql.com\/products\/cluster\/architecture.html\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>By automatically sharding tables in the database, MySQL Cluster eliminates the need to shard at the application layer, greatly simplifying application development and maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>Sharding is based on the hashing of the primary key, though users can override this by telling MySQL Cluster which fields from the primary key should be used in the hashing algorithm. Hashing on the primary key generally leads to a more even distribution of data and queries across the cluster than alternative approached such as range partitioning.<\/p>\n<p>Figure 1 demonstrates how MySQL Cluster shards tables across data nodes of the cluster.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/blogs.oracle.com\/MySQL\/resource\/sharding.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 295px;\" title=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Figure 1: Auto-Sharding in MySQL Cluster<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You will see from the figure above that MySQL Cluster automatically creates \u201cnode groups\u201d from the number of replicas and data nodes specified by the user. Updates are synchronously replicated between members of the node group to protect against data loss and enable sub-second failover in the event of a node failure.<\/p>\n<p>Figure 2 shows how MySQL Cluster creates primary and secondary fragments of each shard.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/blogs.oracle.com\/MySQL\/resource\/fragments.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 344px;\" title=\"2\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Figure 2: Eliminating Data Loss with Cross-Shard Fragments<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MySQL Cluster is an active\/active architecture with multi-master replication, so updates made by any application or SQL node accessing the cluster are instantly available to all of the other nodes accessing the cluster.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike other distributed databases, users do not lose the ability to perform JOIN operations or sacrifice ACID-guarantees. In the Development Release of MySQL Cluster (7.2), Adaptive Query Localization pushes JOIN operations down to the data nodes where they are executed locally and in parallel. We've seen 20-40x higher throughput from the community members that have <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/tech-resources\/articles\/mysql-cluster-labs-dev-milestone-release.html\">tested it.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Geographic Replication<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course, web services are global and so developers will want to ensure their databases can scale-out across regions. MySQL Cluster offers Geographic Replication which distributes clusters to remote data centers, serving to reduce the affects of geographic latency as well as provide a facility for disaster recovery.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"246\" src=\"http:\/\/blogs.oracle.com\/MySQL\/resource\/geo.jpg\" title=\"3\" width=\"279\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Figure 3: Geographic Replication with MySQL Cluster<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Geographic Replication is asynchronous and based on standard MySQL replication \u2013 with one important difference \u2013 it is active\/active so supports the detection and resolution of conflicts when the same row is updated across different clusters. This does currently require the addition of a timestamp column in the application, but that is expected to be eliminated in future releases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where the Rubber Meets the Road<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Auto-sharding and geographic replication are all great technologies, but what do they mean in terms of delivered performance ?<\/p>\n<p>The MySQL Cluster development team recently ran a series of <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/mysql.com\/why-mysql\/benchmarks\/mysql-cluster\/\">benchmarks<\/a> that characterized performance across 8 x dual socket 2.93GHz, 6 core commodity Intel servers, each equipped with 24GB of RAM. As seen in the figure below, MySQL Cluster delivered just under 2.5 million updates per second with 2 x data nodes configured per server.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"208\" src=\"http:\/\/blogs.oracle.com\/MySQL\/resource\/perf.jpg\" title=\"4\" width=\"294\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Figure 4: MySQL Cluster performance scaling-out on commodity nodes.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Across 16 Intel servers, MySQL Cluster achieved just under 7 million read operations per second. We ran out of time in the test cluster before being able to complete the test of write performance, but will return to those efforts soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wrap-Up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So what does all of this mean ? There is an ever-growing array of options for developers to choose from when scaling out new generations of web applications. Don\u2019t assume that relational databases can\u2019t scale, or offer the kind of operational agility demanded by today\u2019s highly dynamic services. MySQL Cluster is already proven as one such option\u2026.and you don\u2019t have to throw away ACID guarantees or the ability to run complex queries to get scalability or schema agility.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn about how MySQL Cluster implements auto-sharding, along with other key features for web services such as online schema updates and NoSQL interfaces from a new <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/event.on24.com\/r.htm?e=311660&amp;s=1&amp;k=3DCFE1CB3E1CF3F0FD0969DC66D93989\">on-demand webinar.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And of course MySQL Cluster is open source, so you are free to download, develop and deploy with it.

A Web Architect is the Web equivalent to a home architect. A Web designer is the Web equivalent to an interior designer. Why do people start at the wrong end for a Web site?<\/span><\/h1>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"content-area\">\n<div id=\"node-8\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>I see countless Web sites that fail because they are pretty and useless. Visitors find they cannot buy what they want in an efficient or accurate manner so they switch to a different safer Web site. One slight mistake can ruin your customer's confidence in your site. An experienced Web Architect can remove most barriers to sales in a short time for relatively little cost. If you leave the repair till next year, the repair becomes more difficult and expensive.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tBenefits of a Web Architect<\/h2>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIncrease sales.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetain customers.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDecrease costs.<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tWeb Designers<\/h2>\n<p>Web site construction often starts with a Web designer, the interior decorator of the Web world. The Web designer produces a pretty looking page and a sketch of how other pages might link in to the first page. People buy what is little more than the selection of wallpaper. They then trust the interior designer to decide on the number of rooms, location of windows, and all sorts of practical issues unrelated to interior decoration.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tWeb <q>Architects<\/q><\/h2>\n<p>I see a few Web Designers are rebranding themselves as Web <q>Architects<\/q>. My terminology caught on and created a new job category. Unfortunately a lot of the <q>Architects<\/q> still have little training outside of producing glossy brochures. Their Web experience is based on Adobe products, not on making things work. They believe the marketing hype about Web 2.0 and push whatever is in fashion instead of what will work for your business.<\/p>\n<p>How do you distinguish the real Web Architects from the born again Web Designers? Before you explain your business to them, ask them about your category of business. When they show you their glossy portfolio, ask them how each example relates to your business. They should show understanding of your business instead of Photoshop tricks.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tBranding Experts<\/h2>\n<p>Branding experts are experts at branding so why waste their talent on Web architecture? Let the branding experts talk with the Web designers. When the Web architect has the plan ready to add the finishing touches, the branding expert and Web designer can add their part.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tComplete Approach<\/h2>\n<p>Web architects bring everything together so need to be involved from the start. They help you plan where the other people fit in the overall plan. Would you let a plumber decide when a tiler should tile? No. Start with the Web architect instead of a person who is an expert at planning only part of the work.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tLong Term Effect<\/h2>\n<p>Your Web site will decide your customer relations for years. You need someone who can look at your requirements long term. Forget their awards for pretty sites. Pretty pages do not generate sales or cut costs. Ask prospective suppliers why they are repeating mistakes made back in the 1980s in the online systems that preceded the Web.<\/p>\n<p>Surely if a large corporation made an obvious public mistake back in 1980 and everyone in the computer industry had the chance to study the mistake, measure the effects, and observe ways to fix the mistake, that mistake should not occur today. The truth is many companies made many mistakes with the early online systems installed during the 1980s and smart people developed ways to prevent those mistakes happening again but few Web designers or Web developers read the lessons from the 1980s. Few universities teach any lessons from information technology history.<\/p>\n<p>Web designers and Web developers often ignore useful research dating back as far as 900 years ago. The ancient Egyptians, when building their first tombs in the Valley of the Kings, observed and documented problems that are repeated daily on Web site development projects.<\/p>\n<p>Good Web architecture is proven 1000% effective compared to good Web design.<\/p>\n<p>Good Web architecture increases sales and saves you money this year and next year and for many years in to the future.<\/p>\n<p>See also: <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/petermoulding.com\/web_sites\">Web Sites<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>In this fairly simple tutorial I\u2019ll show you how to use Drupal to create a simple news archive.<br \/>\n\tWe\u2019ll cover creating a new content type, setting up a new View and then add a bit of theming to smarten things up.<\/p>\n<p>Although I\u2019m focusing this tutorial on creating a news archive the principles can be reused to create lists of any types of content, blog posts, videos, whatever.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tAn Example<\/h2>\n<p>As regular readers will know I always like to have an example of what we\u2019re aiming towards before beginning a tutorial to give some inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent DrupalSN question <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/user\/born2destruct\" target=\"_blank\">born2destruct<\/a> highlighted a pretty nice example on <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ballerstatus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ballerstatus.com<\/a> of something he was looking to recreate in Drupal, so although it\u2019s not a Drupal site I think it\u2019s \u201cRecent Posts\u201d list is a nice example to follow.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"News acrhive example\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"489\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/news-example.png\" width=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to following the above style we\u2019ll also add a nice date list block so news posts can be categorized by month and year making it feel more like a news archive.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tInstall Some Modules<\/h2>\n<p>Rather than go back and forth let\u2019s install all the modules we need in one go.<br \/>\n\tI highly recommend using the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/acquia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Acquia Drupal<\/a> download which is a Drupal bundle which already contains a bunch of useful modules including all the modules we need for this tutorials.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re working with an existing Drupal installation not using Acquia then here are the modules you need to install:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/views\" target=\"_blank\">Views<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/cck\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CCK\">Content Construction Kit<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/filefield\" target=\"_blank\">File Field<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/imagefield\" target=\"_blank\">Image Field<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/imagecache\" target=\"_blank\">ImageCache<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> This list does not include any module dependencies so read each project page for which other modules you will need to install.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tConfigurations<\/h2>\n<p>Let the configurations begin!!<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t1) Create a node type with an imagefield<\/h3>\n<p>To make things easier we\u2019re just going to use the default \u201cstory\u201d node type that come with Drupal (you can create a new node type) which we\u2019ll rename and add an imagefield to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>a)<\/strong> Change the story node type to be called \u201cnews\u201d by navigating to Administer &gt; Content management and clicking the \u201cedit\u201d link under \u201cOperations\u201d and then alter the \u201cIdentification\u201d info changing the Name field to \u201cNews\u201d and the Type field to \u201cnews\u201d, this is not essential but I\u2019m going to do it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>b)<\/strong> Next, click the \u201cmanage fields\u201d link next the \u201cnews\u201d node type again under \u201cOperations\u201d. On the next screen you can see all the fields within the content type and can add new ones. So scroll down to the \u201cNew field\u201d row and input the following and then click the \u201cSave\u201d button.<br \/><img alt=\"CCK Imagefield setup\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"80\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/cck-imagefield.png\" width=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Label: News Image<br \/>\n\tName: news_image<br \/>\n\tType: File<br \/>\n\tOperation: Image<\/p>\n<p><strong>c)<\/strong> On the next screen you can optionally add help text for the new image field or specify a folder (under \u201cPath settings\u201d) to put all our news images in but I\u2019m just going to skip these and just save the default settings.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t2) Create an Imagecache preset<\/h3>\n<p>We don\u2019t want to mess around with resizing our story images before uploading it to story nodes so we\u2019ll <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/163561\" target=\"_blank\">create a new imagecache preset<\/a> and let that do the resizing for us.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the Baller Status website their story images are resized to 200px by 150px which looks pretty nice so we\u2019ll add a new imagecache preset consisting of two actions. The first a \u201cscale\u201d action which scales the image to 200px with and then a \u201ccrop\u201d action which crops it into 200px wide by 150px high square. I\u2019ve called my preset \u201cnews_thumbnail\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/163561\" target=\"_blank\">Here\u2019s a good overview on creating image presets on drupal.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>PUT THE NEW IMAGECACHE PRESET INTO USE<\/strong><br \/>\n\tNow navigate to Administer &gt; Content management &gt; Content Types &gt; Edit news &gt; Display fields and set the \u201cNews Image\u201d field to use the new \u201cnews_thumbnail\u201d preset by selecting it on the drop down menus under \u201cTeaser\u201d and \u201cFull node\u201d.<br \/>\n\tWe want the image to be a link to the full node on our teaser list so change the teaser option to \u201cnews_thumbnail image linked to node\u201d then save the settings.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Display fields settings\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"81\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/display-fields.png\" width=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>\n\t3) The News Archive View<\/h3>\n<p><strong>DUMMY CONTENT<\/strong><br \/>\n\tBefore we start creating our View go ahead and create some test \u201cnews\u201d posts with a news image attached OR use the devel generate module in the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/projects\/devel\" target=\"_blank\">devel module<\/a> package to generate some dummy content for you. Doing this gives us some content to check out View is working correctly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE VIEW<\/strong><br \/>\n\tNot everyone will be aware but the Views module (I believe) comes with a default View called \u201carchive\u201d which is what we\u2019ll use as our starting point because it already the neat little date list block so posts can be categorized by month and year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>a)<\/strong> So navigate to Administer &gt; Site building &gt; Views, scroll down and find the grayed out \u201carchive\u201d View and click the \u201cenable\u201d link on the right to make the View useable:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Enable archive view\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"167\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/archive-view-enable.png\" width=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>b)<\/strong> Next, click the \u201cclone\u201d click on the the newly enabled \u201carchive\u201d View and on the next screen change the name to \u201cnews_archive\u201d and the \u201cViews Tag\u201d to \u201cMy Custom View\u201d or something like that and then click \u201cNext\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>c)<\/strong> As our View is basically already set up for us we only need to make two changes to it:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Add a new Filter<\/strong> for \u201cNode: Type\u201d so we only pull up \u201cstory\u201d nodes in our news archive. We\u2019ll apply the filter to both the page and block display within the View so you can make the change with the default display selected.<br \/>\n\tSo under \u201cFilters\u201d click the \u201c+\u201d sign and add a filter for \u201cNode: Type\u201d, click \u201cadd\u201d and on the next screen check the \u201cnews\u201d box and click \u201cupdate\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Views Filter settings\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"233\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/views-filter.png\" width=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Alter the Argument<\/strong> setting under the Page display by first making sure you have the Page display active then under \u201cArguments\u201d clicking on the \u201cNode: Created year + month\u201d link.<br \/>\n\tNext, click the \u201cOverride\u201d button in the top right (so that these changes will only alter the Page display and no other) and then under \u201cAction to take if argument is not present\u201d change it to \u201cDisplay all values\u201d, this will make our news archive show all news items if no specific month and year are given.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Views arguments\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"263\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/views-argument.png\" width=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Save the View and then go to the blocks admin page and enable the new \u201cArchive list\u201d block, setting it to only show on the archive pages (archive, archive\/*) under the \u201cPage specific visibility settings\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Archive block\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"285\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/archive-block.png\" width=\"235\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>OPTIONAL VIEWS CHANGES<\/strong><br \/>\n\tYou may optionally want to tweak the View to suit your needs for example the current View page URL is \u201carchive\u201d which you may want to change to \u201cnews\u201d or something else.<br \/>\n\tFeel free to play around and if you mess the View up you can just clone the \u201carchive\u201d View again and again.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t4) A spot of theming<\/h3>\n<p>You may have noticed the we didn\u2019t add any fields to our View choosing to use a \u201cnode\u201d \u201crow style\u201d instead. This was done deliberately so that we can do all our theming for the items in the news archive list and news items node view (when you click to view the news item in full) in one place (ie. one template (.tpl) file) and use the same base CSS code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ADD A NEW .TPL FILE<\/strong><br \/>\n\tIn your themes root folder (where the themes .info file is ie. garland.info) copy the node.tpl.php file and then rename it node-news.tpl.php and open it.<br \/>\n\tCopy and paste the following code into the new file:<\/p>\n<div>\n\t<code><code>&lt;divcolor: #000000\"&gt;&lt;?php echo !$page ? 'node-teaser-view' : 'node-full-view'; ?&gt;\"&gt;<br \/> &lt;div id=\"node-&lt;?php print $node-&gt;nid; ?&gt;\"color: #000000\"&gt;&lt;?php echo !$page ? ' node-teaser-view' : 'node-full-view'; ?&gt; clear-block\"&gt; <\/code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;?php echo $node-&gt;field_news_image&lt;a href=\"#fn21283583954e4b2e78072b5\"&gt;0&lt;\/a&gt;['view']; \/\/output the news image ?&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n<p>&lt;?php if ($page == 0): \/\/if teaser view title is shown and a link ?&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"&lt;?php print $node_url ?&gt;\" title=\"&lt;?php print $title ?&gt;\"&gt;&lt;?php print $title ?&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<\/p>\n<p>&lt;?php if ($submitted): ?&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;span&gt;&lt;?php print $submitted; ?&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;?php if ($links): ?&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t| &lt;span&gt;&lt;?php print $links; ?&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<\/p>\n<p>&lt;div&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;?php print $node-&gt;content['body']['#value']; \/\/content has already been run through check_markup function so should be secure (see: node_prepare) ?&gt;<br \/>\n\t\t&lt;\/div&gt;<\/p>\n<p><code>&lt;\/div&gt;<br \/> &lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/p>\n<\/code><\/div>\n<p>As I said we\u2019re using pretty much the same template for both teaser (list) and node view but if you look at the top line you\u2019ll notice the node code is wrapped with another div which gets assigned a class depending on whether we are in teaser (class node-teaser-view) or node view (class node-full-view). This means we can alter the display for teaser (list) or node view with CSS without having to change the template HTML code (although we have that option if we need it).<br \/>\n\tNotice I\u2019ve tried to make the layout similar to the example we noted at the start of this tutorial so I\u2019m not using all the available node variables.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SOME CSS CODE<\/strong><br \/>\n\tOpen up your themes style.css file and add the following:<\/p>\n<p>1) On our teaser list view lets add a border to the bottom of each item and a bit of spaces:<\/p>\n<div>\n\t<code>\/**<br \/> * @group news archive<br \/> *\/<br \/> .node-teaser-view .node {<br \/> padding-bottom: 1em;<br \/> margin-bottom: 1em;<br \/> border-bottom: 1px dotted #ccc;<br \/> }<\/code><\/div>\n<p>2) Now lets align the news image to left for both the teaser &amp; node view:<\/p>\n<div>\n\t<code>.field-field-news-images {<br \/> float: left;<br \/> margin-right: 1em;<br \/> }<\/code><\/div>\n<p>That should give you a pretty nice layout for both teaser &amp; node view (even with the devel temporary images) which you can easily expand on as you please.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Archive teaser list\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"470\" src=\"http:\/\/drupalsn.com\/files\/u1\/acrhive-teaser-list.png\" width=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this tutorial, thanks for reading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you like what you read here please comment below and make any suggestions you have to expand on this tutorial.<\/strong><\/p>\n"

The good news is that the keywords in the subdomain name carry SEO importance, just like the keywords in the domain name. Combine that with the fact that Google sees each subdomain as a separate website, you\u2019ve got a great way to create lots of backlinks.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another Google advantage. As it is now, each search results page on Google will show a maximum of two listings from the same website. But if you set up subdomains, it\u2019s possible to dominate all 10 listings on the first results page of Google!<\/p>\n<p>So subdomains can offer big SEO (<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Search_engine_optimization\" target=\"_blank\">Search Engine Optimization<\/a>) advantages as well as looking professional.<\/p>\n<p>We have all heard by now the advantages of having a blog for promoting your website. So why not try it and create a blog using this technique and subdomains for your site!<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your blog, adding a link to it on your menu takes a couple of seconds, and voila \u2013 your blog is up and running. This is the part where you feverishly start posting articles about your niche market, your product, or your service, and link to your website from each article.<\/p>\n<p>Blogs are amazing: Search Engines love them, and they generally get good PR very quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck and I hope this tutorial will show you the importance of using subdomains.<\/p>\n<p><span data-mce-style=\"font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;\" style=\"font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;\">Subdomain Setup<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get stuck in and set up our subdomains.<\/p>\n<div>\n\t<em>If you want to test this you can download <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.apachefriends.org\/en\/xampp-windows.html\" target=\"_blank\">XAMPP<\/a> or <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wampserver.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">WAMP<\/a> and have your local computer run like a server.

            "articleBody": "<p>In this article by <strong>David Mercer<\/strong>, we will look at an entirely different aspect of running a Drupal website. Once we have added the functionality to the site, we now have to give some thoughts about how this functionality is to be accessed, or by whom. As the site grows, you will most likely feel the need to delegate certain responsibilities to various people. Alternatively, you might organize a team of people to work on specific aspects of the site. Whatever is required, at some stage you will have to make decisions about who can do what, and Drupal makes sure that it is possible to do precisely this.<\/p>\n<p>Having Drupal simplify the implementation of your access control policies does not mean that the task is a trivial one. There is still much thought that needs to go on behind the scenes in order to create a sophisticated, and above all, effective policy for controlling access to the site. Because of this, we will spend a bit of time exploring the ramifications of the various choices available, instead of simply listing them. Taking a holistic approach to implementing an access control policy will ensure you don't end up with any nasty surprises down the line.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, this article will look at <strong>Planning an access policy<\/strong>, <strong>Roles<\/strong>, <strong>Users<\/strong>, and <strong>Access rules<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Before we continue, it is worth pointing out that at the moment of adding the basic functionality you are more than likely using the administrative user (user number 1) for all the site's development needs. That is absolutely fine, but once the major changes to the site are completed, you should begin using a normal administrative user that has only the permissions required to complete your day-to-day tasks. The next section will highlight the general philosophy behind user access, which should make the reason for this clear.<\/p>\n<h1>\n\tPlanning an Access Policy<\/h1>\n<p>When you think about how your site should work, focus in on what will be required of yourself, other community members, or even anonymous users. For instance:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tWill there be a team of moderators working to ensure that the content of the site conforms to the dictates of good taste and avoids material that is tantamount to hate speech, and so on?<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tWill there be subject experts who are allowed to create and maintain their own content?<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tHow much will anonymous visitors be allowed to become involved, or will they be forced to merely window shop without being able to contribute?<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Some of you might feel that the site should grow organically with the community, and so you want to be extremely flexible in your approach. However, you can take it as given that Drupal's access policies are already flexible, given how easy it is to reconfigure, so it is good practice to start out with a sensible set of access rules, even if they are going to change over time. If you need to make modifications later, so be it, but at least there will be a coherent set of rules from the start.<\/p>\n<p>The first and foremost rule of security that can be applied directly to our situation is<\/p>\n<p><em>Grant a user permissions sufficient for completing the intended task, and no more!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Our entire approach is going to be governed by this rule. With a bit of thought you should be able to see why this is so important. The last thing anyone wants is for an anonymous user to be able to modify the personal blog of a respected industry expert. This means that each type of user should have carefully controlled permissions that effectively block their ability to act outside the scope of their remit.<\/p>\n<p>One upshot of this is that it is better to create a larger number of specific roles, rather than create a generic role or two, and allow everyone to use those catch-all permissions.<\/p>\n<p><em>A role constitutes a number of permissions that define what actions any members of that role can and can't perform.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We will explore roles in detail in the next section!<\/p>\n<p>Drupal gives us fine-grained control over what users can accomplish, and you should make good use of this facility. It may help to think of your access control using the following figure (this does not necessarily represent the actual roles on your site\u2014it's just an example):<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image1.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The shaded region represents the total number of permissions available for the site. Contained within this set are the various roles that exist either by default, like the <strong>Anonymous users<\/strong> role, or those you create in order to cater for the different types of users the site will require\u2014in this case, the <strong>Blog Writer users<\/strong> and <strong>Forum Moderator users<\/strong> roles.<\/p>\n<p>From the previous diagram you can see that the <strong>Anonymous users<\/strong> role has the smallest set of permissions because they have the smallest area of the total diagram. This set of permissions is totally encapsulated by the <strong>Forum Moderator users<\/strong> and <strong>Blog Writer users<\/strong>\u2014meaning that forum moderators and blog writers can do everything an anonymous user does, and a whole lot more.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, it is not compulsory that forum moderators encapsulate all the permissions of the anonymous users. You can assign any permissions to any role\u2014it's just that in this context it makes sense that a forum moderator should be able to do everything an anonymous user can and more.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the blog writers have a slightly different remit. While they share some privileges in common with the forum administrators, they also have a few of their own. Your permissions as the primary or administrative user encompass the entire set, because there should be nothing that you cannot control.<\/p>\n<p>It is up to you to decide which roles are best for the site, but before attempting this it is important to ask:<em>What are roles and how are they used in the first place?<\/em> To answer this question, let's take a look at the practical side of things in more detail.<\/p>\n<h1>\n\tRoles<\/h1>\n<p>It may seem a bit odd that we are not beginning a practical look at access control with a discussion on users. After all, it is all about what users can and cannot do! The problem with immediately talking about users is that the focus of a single user is too narrow, and we can learn far more about controlling access by taking a more broad view using roles. Once we have learned everything there is to know about roles, actually working with users becomes a trivial matter.<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned, a user role in Drupal defines a set of rules that must be obeyed by all the users in that role. It may be helpful to think of a role as a character in a play. In a play, an actor must always be true to their character (in the same way a user must be faithful to their role in Drupal)\u2014in other words, there is a defined way to behave and the character never deviates (no matter which actor portrays the character).<\/p>\n<p>Creating a role in Drupal is very easy. Click the <strong>User management<\/strong> link under <strong>Administer<\/strong> and select the<strong>Roles<\/strong> tab to bring up the following:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image2.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, we have two roles already defined by default\u2014the <strong>anonymous user<\/strong> and the<strong>authenticated user<\/strong>. It is not possible to change these, and so the <strong>Operations<\/strong> column is permanently set to <strong>locked<\/strong>. To begin with, the anonymous user (this is any user who is browsing the site without logging in) has very few permissions set, and you would more than likely want to keep it this way, despite the fact it is possible to give them any and all permissions.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, the authenticated user, by default, has only a few more permissions than the anonymous user, and it is also sensible to keep these to a minimum. We will see in a little while how to go about deciding who should have which permissions.<\/p>\n<p>In order to add a new role, type in a name for the role and click <strong>Add role<\/strong>, and you're done. But what name do you want to add? That's the key question! If you are unsure about what name to use, then it is most likely you haven't defined the purpose of the role properly. To see how this is done, let's assume we require a forum moderator who will be a normal user in every way, except for the ability to work directly on the forums (to take some of the burden of responsibility off the administrator's hands) to create new topics, and to edit the content if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>To get the ball rolling, type in <strong>forum moderator<\/strong> and click <strong>Add role<\/strong>\u2014actually, you might even want to be more specific and use something like <strong>conservation forum moderator<\/strong> if there will be teams of forum moderators\u2014you get the general idea.<\/p>\n<p>Now the <strong>roles<\/strong> page should display the new role with the option to edit it, shown in the <strong>Operations<\/strong>column. Click <strong>edit role<\/strong> in order to change the name of the role or delete it completely. Alternatively, click<strong>edit permissions<\/strong> to deal with the permissions for this specific role (we discuss permissions in a moment so let's leave this for now).<\/p>\n<p>Our work is just beginning, because now we need to grant or deny the various permissions that the <strong>forum moderator<\/strong> role will need in order to successfully fulfill its purpose. New roles are not given any permission at all to begin with\u2014this makes sense, because the last thing we want is to create a role only to find that it has the same permissions as the administrative user.<\/p>\n<p>Chances are you will need to add several roles depending on the needs of the site, so add at least a<strong>blogger user<\/strong> that can edit their own blog\u2014we will need a few different types to play with later on.<\/p>\n<p>Let's move on and take a look at how to flesh out this new role by setting permissions.<\/p>\n<h1>\n\tPermissions<\/h1>\n<p>In order to work with permissions, click the <strong>Permissions<\/strong> link under <strong>User management<\/strong> and you should be presented with a screen much like the following (notice the new <strong>forum moderator<\/strong> role on the right-hand side of the page):<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image3.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, this page lists all of the available permissions down the left-hand column and allows you to enable or disable that permission by checking or un-checking boxes in the relevant column. It is easy enough to see that one traverses the list, selecting those permissions required for each role. What is not so easy is actually determining what should and shouldn't be enabled in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Notice too that the permissions given in the list on the left-hand side pertain to specific modules. This means that if we change the site's setup by adding or removing modules, then we will also have to change the permissions on this page.<\/p>\n<p><em>Most times a module is added, you will need to ensure that the permissions are set as required for that module, because by default no permissions are granted.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What else can we learn from the permissions page shown in the previous screenshot? Well, what does each permission precisely mean? There are quite a few verbs that allow for completely different actions. The following lists the more common, generic ones, although you might find one or two others crop up every now and then to cater for a specific module:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<strong>administer<\/strong>: gives the user the ability to affect the function of a module. For example, granting administer rights to the locale module means that the user can add or remove languages, manage strings, and even export .po files. This permission should only ever be given to trusted users, and never to anonymous users.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>access<\/strong>: gives the user the ability to make use of a module without being able to affect it in any way. For example, granting access rights to the comment module allows a user to view comments without being able to delete, edit, or reply to them.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>create<\/strong>: gives the user the ability to create content of some sort. For example, granting rights to create stories allows users to do so, but does not also give them the ability to edit those stories.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>edit any\/own<\/strong>: gives the user the ability to work with either anyone's content or specifically the content<em>they have created<\/em>\u2014depending on whether edit any or edit own is selected. For example, granting <strong>edit own<\/strong> rights to the <em>blog<\/em> module means that the user can modify their own blogs at will.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>delete any\/own<\/strong>: applies to content related modules such as <strong>Node<\/strong> and empowers users to remove either anyone's content or confine them to removing only content posted by themselves. For example, setting <strong>delete own blog<\/strong> entry allows users to take back any blog postings they may regret having published.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>There are also other module-specific permissions available, and it is recommended that you play around and understand any new permission(s) you set.<\/p>\n<p><em>Previously, assigning the <\/em><strong>edit own<\/strong><em> permission automatically provided the <\/em><strong>delete own<\/strong><em>permission. For added security, <\/em><strong>delete own<\/strong><em> permissions for individual core content types have been removed from all roles and should be assigned separately.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>How do we go about setting up the required permissions for the forum moderator user? If we look down the list of permissions shown on the <strong>Permission<\/strong> page, we see the following forum-related options (at the moment, the <strong>forum moderator<\/strong> permissions are those in the outermost column):<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"287\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image4.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"484\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Enabling these three options, and then testing out what new powers are made available, should quickly demonstrate that this is not quite what we want.<\/p>\n<p>If you are wondering how to actually test this out, you need to create a new user and then assign them to the <strong>forum moderator<\/strong> role. The following section on <em>Users<\/em> explains how to create new users and administer them properly. Jump ahead quickly and check that out so that you have a new user to work with if you are unsure how it is done.<\/p>\n<p>The following point might make your life a bit easier:<\/p>\n<p><em>Use two browsers to test out your site. The demo site's development machine has IE and Firefox. Keep one browser for the administrator and the other for anonymous or other users in order to test out changes. This will save you from having to log in and log out whenever testing new permissions.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When testing out the new permissions one way or another, you will find that the forum moderator can access and work with all of the forums\u2014assuming you have created any.<\/p>\n<p>However, notice that there are <strong>node module<\/strong> permissions available, which is quite interesting because most content in Drupal is actually a node. How will this affect the forum moderator? Disable the <strong>forum module<\/strong> permissions for the <strong>forum moderator user<\/strong> and then enable all the node options for the<strong>authenticated user<\/strong> before saving and logging out.<\/p>\n<p>Log back in as the <strong>forum administrator<\/strong> and it will be clear that despite having revoked the forum based options for this user, it is possible to post to or edit anything in the forum quite easily by selecting the<strong>Create content<\/strong> link in the main menu. Is this what you expected?<\/p>\n<p>It should be precisely what you expect because the forum moderator is an <strong>authenticated user<\/strong>, so they have acquired the permissions that came from the <strong>authenticated user<\/strong>. In addition, the forum posts are all nodes, and any authenticated user can add and edit nodes, so even though the forum moderator is not explicitly allowed to work with forums, through generic node permissions we get the same result:<\/p>\n<p><em>Defined roles are given the <\/em><strong><em>authenticated user<\/em><\/strong><em> permissions.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Actually, the result is not entirely the same because the <strong>forum moderator<\/strong> can now also configure all the different types of content on the site, as well as edit any type of content including other people's blogs. This is most certainly undesirable, so log back in as the primary user and remove the node permissions (except the first one) from the <strong>authenticated user<\/strong> role. With that done, you can now spend some time building a fairly powerful and comprehensive role-based access control plan.<\/p>\n<p>As an addendum, you might find that despite having a goodly amount of control over who does what, there are some things that are not easily done without help from elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h1>\n\tUsers<\/h1>\n<p>A single user account can be given as many or as few permissions as you like via the use of roles. Drupal users are not really anything unless they already have a role that defines the manner in which they can operate within the Drupal framework. Hence, we discussed roles first.<\/p>\n<p>Users can be created in two ways. The most common way is by registering on the site\u2014if you haven't already, go ahead and register a new user on your site by clicking the <strong>Create new account<\/strong> link on the homepage just to test things out. Remember to supply a valid email address otherwise you won't be able to sign in properly. This will create an authenticated user, with any and all permissions that have been assigned to the <strong>authenticated user<\/strong> role.<\/p>\n<p>The second way is to use the administrative user to create a new user. In order to do so, log on as the administrative user and click on <strong>Users<\/strong> in <strong>User management<\/strong> under <strong>Administer<\/strong>. Select the <strong>Add user<\/strong> tab and follow the instructions on that page. For example, I created a new forum moderator user by ensuring that the relevant role was checked:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image5.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You will need to supply Drupal with usernames, email addresses, and passwords. Once there are a couple of users to play around with, it's time to begin working with them.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tAdministering Users<\/h2>\n<p>The site's administrator is given complete access to the other users' account information. By clicking on the <strong>edit<\/strong> link shown to the right of each user account (under the <strong>Operations<\/strong> column heading) in the <strong>Users<\/strong>page under <strong>User management<\/strong>, it is possible to make any changes you require to a given user.<\/p>\n<p>Before we do though, it's worth noting that the administration page itself is fairly powerful in terms of being able to administer individual users or groups of users with relative ease:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image6.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The upper box, <strong>Show only users where<\/strong>, allows you to specify several filter conditions to cut down the result set and make it more manageable. This will become more and more important as the site accumulates more and more users. Once the various filter options have been implemented, the <strong>Update options<\/strong> allow you to apply whatever changes are needed to the list of users selected (by checking the relevant checkbox next to their name).<\/p>\n<p>Having both broad, sweeping powers as well as fine-grained control over users is one of the most valuable facilities provided by Drupal, and you will no doubt become very familiar with this page in due course.<\/p>\n<p>Click on the <strong>edit<\/strong> link next to the <strong>forum moderator user<\/strong> and take a look at the <strong>Roles<\/strong> section. Notice that it is now possible to stipulate which roles this user belongs to. At present there are only two new roles to be assigned (yours might vary depending on which roles have been created on your setup):<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"93\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image7.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"480\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whenever a user is added to another role, they obtain the <strong>combined permissions<\/strong> of these roles. With this in mind, you should go about delegating roles in the following fashion:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tDefine the most basic user of the site by setting the <strong>anonymous user<\/strong> permissions.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSet permissions for a basic <strong>authenticated user<\/strong> (i.e. any Tom, Dick or Harry that registers on your site).<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCreate special roles by only adding the <em>specific additional permissions<\/em> that are required by that role, and no more. Don't re-assign permissions that the authenticated user already has.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCreate new users by combining whatever roles are required for their duties or needs.<\/li>\n<\/ol><div>\n<div id=\"node-1176\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>If you follow the steps above, you will be sure to always give the correct permissions to each role by avoiding redundancy and only applying permissions incrementally by role. Basically, you are building up a user's permissions from the most basic to the most complex without having to assign every single permission each time. It should be commonsense (although not a technical obligation) that a forum moderator would have all the permissions of an anonymous and authenticated user, plus a few more. Looking back to the first diagram in the section <em>Planning an Access Policy<\/em> you can see that, in this case, we would:<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tDefine the <strong>anonymous user<\/strong> and <strong>authenticated user<\/strong> role permissions\u2014an authenticated user should have all the permissions of an anonymous user, plus whatever else is needed by a basic site user.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCreate new roles with only the additional permissions needed for both the <strong>forum moderator<\/strong>and <strong>blog user<\/strong> respectively\u2014other than those given to the authenticated user.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tAssign blog writers to the <strong>blog user<\/strong> role (they are automatically given the permissions granted to an authenticated user), and do the same for forum moderators and their role.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Other than using that strategy for assigning roles to users, the rest, as they say, is history. Play around with any new roles you create to ensure they behave as you expect and then move on.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tUser Settings<\/h2>\n<p>This section looks at how the site treats users, rather than discussing what users can and cannot do. However, you will find that some of the information in this section is important for the look and feel of the site.<\/p>\n<p>Click on User settings under the User management. The following set of options is provided, beginning with user registration settings, as follows:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image8.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You might want to consider which of the first three options to select quite carefully, depending on how you envisage the site functioning. For example, allowing everyone to read and post comments to the forums, or do whatever, without needing to register first may be ideal. If this is the case, then it is likely that the only people who would need to register are going to be performing some sort of administrative duties, in which case you would probably want to select the first option, or at least the third option.<\/p>\n<p>If you do go for the third option, then check the user list regularly in order to unblock new users as soon as possible. Note that Drupal can be configured to email the site administrator automatically whenever there is a new user registration application.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"52\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image9.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Additionally, if you enter a message into the <strong>User registration guidelines<\/strong> text area then this will appear during the registration process, as shown in the following screenshot:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image10.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I specifically added this note in here because it is fairly well known that new users often log in with the one-time password generated by Drupal, but then fail to add their own password before logging off. When they return, they are then locked out because the one-time password has expired and there is no new one set.<\/p>\n<p>The next section on this page deals with the process of user email customization for the various different type of emails that Drupal sends out. There is an interesting facet to this in that Drupal makes certain variables available for use within the static text that is entered. Let's take a look at how to modify a line or so in order to get the feel for how it works.<\/p>\n<p>By way of example, we will change the <strong>Welcome, no approval<\/strong> text from:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Account details for !username at !site<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>to a slightly sprightlier:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Congratulations !username, you have registered with the !site on !date!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nothing too complicated here! The keywords preceded by the ! sign are simply placeholders for other values that are inserted into the email, according to how they are set at that particular time. This gives you the ability to personalize correspondence. In this case, the subject of the welcome email for a user registered as <strong>David M<\/strong> is now displayed as follows:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image11.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The <strong>!username<\/strong>, <strong>!site<\/strong>, and <strong>!date<\/strong> placeholders have been correctly changed to reflect the contents of the variables for that particular setup. There are settings available for several standard emails such as<strong>password recovery<\/strong> and <strong>welcome (awaiting admin approval)<\/strong>. The defaults are fairly sensible and easy to change should you need to. Remember the placeholders that are available for each piece of text are mentioned below the section heading, so play around with them until you are comfortable with their usage:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"75\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image12.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The final two sections deal with <strong>Signatures<\/strong> and <strong>Pictures<\/strong>. If you wish to enable <strong>Picture support<\/strong> for users, then select <strong>Enabled<\/strong> from the list, provide a default picture (if you want one), and click <strong>Save configuration<\/strong>(the other settings are fairly self explanatory and sensible, and you can come back at any stage to change them if they are not suitable).<\/p>\n<p>Drupal will set up a pictures folder to hold all of the pictures within the files folder in your Drupal installation. Once everything is done, users will have a new section added to the <strong>edit<\/strong> tab of their <strong>my account<\/strong> page, like the following figure:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"215\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image13.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When the picture has been successfully uploaded, it will appear on the <strong>my account<\/strong> page, and with the user's blog and forum posts on the site. If the image does not appear and you end up seeing a link, something like the following:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"33\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image14.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"108\" \/><\/p>\n<p>...then you will need to ensure that you set the correct <strong>upload module<\/strong> permissions on the <strong>Permissions<\/strong>page, as follows:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"92\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image15.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember that since the <strong>forum administrator<\/strong> user automatically receives all the permissions of the<strong>authenticated<\/strong> user, it is not necessary to enable the <strong>view uploaded files<\/strong> permission for the <strong>forum administrator<\/strong> as this would be redundant and would make the purpose of your user less clear.<\/p>\n<p>It is possible to control where the user pictures are displayed by selecting the <strong>Configure<\/strong> tab of the<strong>Themes<\/strong> page under <strong>Site building<\/strong> and checking the relevant picture related checkboxes, as shown in the following figure:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"550\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image16.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Allowing users to incorporate pictures into a site is a good way for people to be able to personalize their contributions, and also gives everyone something visual to associate posts with. This is a great way to foster a community, as it helps give different users an identity of sorts.<\/p>\n<p>Changing the picture is easy! Simply modify it in the <strong>Picture<\/strong> section of the user's edit page, as shown in the following screenshot:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" height=\"171\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image17.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" width=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That is pretty much the end of the line for configuring users. There are still a few more things we need to discuss with regards to security before we can move on though.<\/p>\n<h1>\n\tAccess Rules<\/h1>\n<p>So far it should seem like Drupal has things more or less covered when it comes to ensuring that it is possible to control who does what on the site. This is certainly the case, but there are a few more situations that we have not yet discussed, and may well end up affecting the site at some stage. For example, what happens if there is a company that repeatedly spams your forums with advertisements and marketing information? Or, what happens if only people from a certain company should have access to your site?<\/p>\n<p>Problems of this nature can really be a thorn in the side. Access problems can even end up driving community members away\u2014unless you have the ability to set access rules.<\/p>\n<p>There are some techniques that can be used to set access rules via the <strong>Access rules<\/strong> link under <strong>User management<\/strong>. To implement any access rules you will need to select the <strong>Add rule<\/strong> option, which brings up the following page:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image18.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From this you can see that I am in the process of making a rule that denies access based on an email address\u2014more specifically, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"mailto:really@nastyspammer.com\">really@nastyspammer.com<\/a>. Before we continue on this line, it is important to note that there are both <strong>Allow<\/strong> and <strong>Deny<\/strong> options available, and these will act based on a supplied<strong>Username<\/strong>, <strong>E-mail<\/strong>, or <strong>Host<\/strong> address given in the <strong>Rule type<\/strong> section. The final option, <strong>Mask<\/strong>, allows you to specify the actual name of the user or host to which the rule will apply.<\/p>\n<p>In the above case, the email address <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"mailto:really@nastyspammer.com\">really@nastyspammer.com<\/a> will have a <strong>deny<\/strong> rule created after <strong>Add rule<\/strong> has been clicked.<\/p>\n<p>Go ahead and create a rule like this one, and notice that the rule now appears under the <strong>list<\/strong> tab. Now that there is a <strong>deny<\/strong> rule in place, how do we go about using it? The answer is that it is already being used. If someone tries to register with the email address supplied in the rule, they will be denied access. As it stands, this is probably not very helpful, because it is unlikely you will know ahead of time what specific email addresses to block.<\/p>\n<p>In order to cater for the times when you aren't entirely sure of the specific address, there are two wildcard characters provided that can serve as generic strings or characters. Imagine you wanted to ban someone who runs a small spamming business. Simply blocking their current email address is not really sufficient, because they can easily create another address and use that one to register. If you know that the addresses come from one location, such as:<\/p>\n<pre>\n&lt;some characters&gt;@irritating_spammer.com<\/pre><p>...you could use the % character to match whatever characters are present before the @ sign, effectively stopping anyone from that email server from registering, like so:<\/p>\n<pre>\n%@irritating_spammer.com<\/pre><p>If you have a Hotmail account, or something similar, try blocking any address that ends with @hotmail.com and then attempt to register an account on the site. Drupal will dutifully display the following message:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image19.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A new problem rears its ugly head when it so happens that you don't want to allow Hotmail addresses on the site, with the exception of a close personal friend who is traveling around the world and can only access Hotmail addresses. In this case, you need to set an <strong>Allow<\/strong> rule as well. If, for example, the email address of the person is <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"mailto:good_friend@hotmail.com\">good_friend@hotmail.com<\/a>, then you could set the <strong>Allow<\/strong> rule by selecting the appropriate options to cater for this on the <strong>add rule<\/strong> page.<\/p>\n<p>The rules would then look something like the following:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" border=\"0\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/www.packtpub.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Article-Images\/drupal-6-article-image20.png\" title=\"User Access Control in Drupal 6\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What this does is ban all Hotmail addresses from the site. However, because <em>an<\/em> <strong>allow<\/strong> <em>rule takes precedence over a<\/em> <strong>deny<\/strong> <em>rule<\/em>, the one and only Hotmail address specified in the single <strong>allow<\/strong> rule shown in the screenshot will work fine. Now when your good friend attempts to register, everything will go swimmingly well.<\/p>\n<p>After adding plenty of rules, things can sometimes become slightly confusing and it is simply not feasible to continue attempting to register new names all the time, to ensure that they work according to plan. In this case, use the <strong>Check rules<\/strong> tab on the right-hand side of the <strong>Access rules<\/strong> page. This allows names of users, email addresses, and hosts to be entered in order to check whether they have access or not. Simply compare these results with your expectations to determine if everything is working as planned.<\/p>\n<p>One final thing to bear in mind is that if you deny access using the host criteria, then this will be enforced throughout the site and not just on the registration pages. For the case of the spammer, you would probably want to deny access to the site in general; so you would select the <strong>host<\/strong> option with something like this for the <strong>Mask:<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre>\n<strong>%irritating_spammer% <\/strong><\/pre><p>This would then match to any host with irritating_spammer in it. For example:<\/p>\n<pre>\nwww.really_irritating_spammer.com\nwww.mildly_irritating_spammer.com\nwww.extremelyirritating_spammer.org\nwww.unbelievably_irritating_spammer.comms.org.co.sz<\/pre><p>...and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to realize that this only applies to the host criteria:<\/p>\n<p>If an undesirable user has already registered with an <strong>email address<\/strong> that is <em>subsequently<\/em> blocked, then no action will be taken against them.<\/p>\n<p>Remember to check that all the added rules have the desired effect on the site's access policy. It would be a shame to make a rule that prevented potentially valuable community members from accessing content, causing them to go elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention, before finishing off, that there are a number of other <strong>user access\/authentication<\/strong>-related modules available on the Drupal website. It is probably worthwhile to check these out at <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/Modules\/category\/74\" title=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/Modules\/category\/74\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/Modules\/category\/74<\/a> in case there is something that is particularly suited to your needs.<\/p>\n<h1>\n\tSummary<\/h1>\n<p>This article provided a good grounding in the basics of controlling access to your site's content. Drupal comes with a large number of facilities and options to ensure proper maintenance of the site by retaining overall control with the administrative user, as well as delegating important jobs to trusted users via the use of roles.<\/p>\n<p>We looked at how to go about planning an access policy. This is not only an important requirement, in terms of making sure the site runs smoothly, but also helps to solidify how the site will eventually work by forcing you to consider many eventualities. A tour of the fundamental aspects of access control in Drupal saw us discussing roles, permissions, and users, and learning how to plan and implement an access policy based on the requirements of the site.<\/p>\n<p>Access rules were then introduced as a further way of controlling who gets into the site, with a discussion on how to use the wildcard characters effectively. Planning, and above all, testing, will help ensure that everything works as intended.<\/p>\n<p>With that, we are done with access control, although you are strongly urged to spend some time playing around with the various options until you are comfortable with being able to make changes and understanding their effects.<\/p>\n"

This means that their creators don\u2019t need to set callback-function manually. Many of the core function are already converted. Thus themes creators have less work.

            "articleBody": "<p>One of the most confusing aspects of CSS styling is the application of the <strong>font-size<\/strong> attribute for text scaling. In CSS, you\u2019re given four different units by which you can measure the size of text as it\u2019s displayed in the web browser. Which of these four units is best suited for the web? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s spawned a diverse variety of debate and criticism. Finding a definitive answer can be difficult, most likely because the question, itself, is so difficult to answer.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tMeet the Units<\/h2>\n<ol><li>\n\t\t<strong>\u201cEms\u201d (em):<\/strong> The \u201cem\u201d is a scalable unit that is used in web document media. An em is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 12pt. Ems are scalable in nature, so 2em would equal 24pt, .5em would equal 6pt, etc. Ems are becoming increasingly popular in web documents due to scalability and their mobile-device-friendly nature.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Pixels (px):<\/strong> Pixels are fixed-size units that are used in screen media (i.e. to be read on the computer screen). One pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest division of your screen\u2019s resolution). Many web designers use pixel units in web documents in order to produce a pixel-perfect representation of their site as it is rendered in the browser. One problem with the pixel unit is that it does not scale upward for visually-impaired readers or downward to fit mobile devices.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Points (pt):<\/strong> Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). One point is equal to 1\/72 of an inch. Points are much like pixels, in that they are fixed-size units and cannot scale in size.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<strong>Percent (%):<\/strong> The percent unit is much like the \u201cem\u201d unit, save for a few fundamental differences. First and foremost, the current font-size is equal to 100% (i.e. 12pt = 100%). While using the percent unit, your text remains fully scalable for mobile devices and for accessibility.<\/li>\n<\/ol><h2>\n\tSo, What\u2019s the Difference?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to understand the difference between font-size units when you see them in action. Generally, <strong>1em = 12pt = 16px = 100%<\/strong>. When using these font-sizes, let\u2019s see what happens when you increase the base font size (using the body CSS selector) from 100% to 120%.<\/p>\n<div id=\"elxe\"><a href=\"http:\/\/skravchenko.ru\/index.htm\/check-cashing-payday-loan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/skravchenko.ru\/index.htm\/check-cashing-payday-loan<\/a><\/div>\n<p><img alt=\"Font-sizes as they increase from 100% to 120%.\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/kyleschaeffer.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/font-size-1.gif\" title=\"Font-sizes as they increase from 100% to 120%.\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, both the em and percent units get larger as the base font-size increases, but pixels and points do not. It can be easy to set an absolute size for your text, but it\u2019s much easier on your visitors to use scalable text that can display on any device or any machine. For this reason, the em and percent units are preferred for web document text.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tEm vs. Percent<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve decided that point and pixel units are not necessarily best suited for web documents, which leaves us with the em and percent units. In theory, both the em and the percent units are identical, but in application, they actually have a few minor differences that are important to consider.<\/p>\n<p>In the example above, we used the percent unit as our base font-size (on the body tag). <strong>If you change your base font-size from percent to ems<\/strong> (i.e. <strong>body { font-size: 1em; }<\/strong>), you <em>probably<\/em> won\u2019t notice a difference. Let\u2019s see what happens when \u201c1em\u201d is our body font-size, and when the client alters the \u201cText Size\u201d setting of their browser (this is available in some browsers, such as Internet Explorer).<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Font-size as the client changes the text size in their browser.\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/kyleschaeffer.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/font-size-2.gif\" title=\"Font-size as the client changes the text size in their browser.\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When the client\u2019s browser text size is set to \u201cmedium,\u201d there is no difference between ems and percent. When the setting is altered, however, the difference is quite large. On the \u201cSmallest\u201d setting, ems are much smaller than percent, and when on the \u201cLargest\u201d setting, it\u2019s quite the opposite, with ems displaying much larger than percent. While some could argue that the em units are scaling as they are truly intended, in practical application, the em text scales too abruptly, with the smallest text becoming hardly legible on some client machines.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Verdict<\/h2>\n<p>In theory, the em unit is the new and upcoming standard for font sizes on the web, but in practice, the percent unit seems to provide a more consistent and accessible display for users. When client settings have changed, percent text scales at a reasonable rate, allowing designers to preserve readability, accessibility, and visual design.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The winner:<\/strong> percent (%).<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tAddendum (January 2011)<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s been a couple years since I wrote this post, and I\u2019d like to sum up the discussion and debate that has happened in that time. Generally, when I create a new design, I will use percent on the <code>body<\/code>element (<code>body { font-size: 62.5%; }<\/code>), and then use the <code>em<\/code>unit to size it from there. As long as the <code>body<\/code>is set using the percent unit, you may choose to use either percent or ems on any other CSS rules and selectors and still retain the benefits of using percent as your base font size. Over the past couple of years, this has really become the standard in design.<\/p>\n<p>Pixels are now considered <em>acceptable<\/em> font size units (users can use the browser\u2019s \u201czoom\u201d feature to read smaller text), although they are starting to cause some issues as a result of mobile devices with very high density screens (some Android and iPhone devices have upwards of 200 to 300 pixels per inch, making your 11- and 12-pixel fonts very difficult to see!).<\/p>\n<style>\n<!--\/*--><![CDATA[\/* ><!--*\/\n#elxe{display:none;visibility:hidden;}\n\/*--><!]]>*\/\n<\/style>"

            "articleBody": "<p>Drop-down menus are an accepted and intuitive way of presenting links for large numbers of nested pages on a web page, but Drupal currently lacks a built-in mechanism for easily implementing them. For drop-down menus to work, our generated HTML should include all the items of a given menu, not just those at the top level and in the active trail; plus a flag indicating the current page, if any. While modules like <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/nice_menus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nice Menus<\/a> already exist for providing nested menus in a block, this method makes it possible for drop-downs to appear anywhere lists of menu links currently appear in your theme.<\/p>\n<p>The main challenge with getting this to work is generating the underlying data structure representing the menu hierarchy. While Drupal doesn\u2019t (yet) include a function that does what we need, it does have two functions whose output can be combined. They are:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/api.drupal.org\/api\/function\/menu_tree_page_data\/6\" rel=\"nofollow\">menu_tree_page_data()<\/a>, which when given the name of a menu, returns a tree (a nested array of menu items and metadata) leading to the current page. You can see this function at work generating the main navigation menu. Its output depends on the page that called it.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/api.drupal.org\/api\/function\/menu_tree_all_data\/6\" rel=\"nofollow\">menu_tree_all_data()<\/a>, which returns a tree containing every item in a given menu.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>What we want is a tree which contains every menu item, plus data indicating which item in the menu is the current page. To do that, we\u2019re going to modify the built-in<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/api.drupal.org\/api\/function\/menu_navigation_links\/6\" rel=\"nofollow\">menu_navigation_links()<\/a> function. In its default form, it generates a 1-dimensional array representing the top-level links of a given menu. We\u2019re going to split it into two functions and have them recursively generate a multidimensional array of all the links in a menu. All the following code would be located inside your theme\u2019s folder in the template.php file.<\/p>\n<pre>\n\/**\n * Return a multidimensional array of links for a navigation menu.\n *\n * @param $menu_name\n *   The name of the menu.\n * @param $level\n *   Optional, the depth of the menu to be returned.\n * @return\n *   An array of links of the specified menu and level.\n *\/\nfunction themename_navigation_links($menu_name, $level = 0) {\n  \/\/ Don't even bother querying the menu table if no menu is specified.\n  if (empty($menu_name)) {\n    return array();\n  }\n\n  \/\/ Get the menu hierarchy for the current page.\n  $tree_page = menu_tree_page_data($menu_name);\n  \/\/ Also get the full menu hierarchy.\n  $tree_all = menu_tree_all_data($menu_name);\n\n  \/\/ Go down the active trail until the right level is reached.\n  while ($level-- &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; $tree_page) {\n    \/\/ Loop through the current level's items until we find one that is in trail.\n    while ($item = array_shift($tree_page)) {\n      if ($item['link']['in_active_trail']) {\n        \/\/ If the item is in the active trail, we continue in the subtree.\n        $tree_page = empty($item['below']) ? array() : $item['below'];\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return themename_navigation_links_level($tree_page, $tree_all);\n}\n\n\/**\n * Helper function for themename_navigation_links to recursively create an array of links.\n * (Both trees are required in order to include every menu item and active trail info.)\n *\/\nfunction themename_navigation_links_level($tree_page, $tree_all) {\n  $links = array();\n  foreach ($tree_all as $key =&gt; $item) {\n    $item_page = $tree_page[$key];\n    $item_all = $tree_all[$key];\n    if (!$item_all['link']['hidden']) {\n    \t$class = '';\n      $l = $item_all['link']['localized_options'];\n      $l['href'] = $item_all['link']['href'];\n      $l['title'] = $item_all['link']['title'];\n      if ($item_page['link']['in_active_trail']) {\n      \t$class = ' active-trail';\n      }\n      if ($item_all['below']) {\n        $l['children'] = themename_navigation_links_level($item_page['below'], $item_all['below']);\n      }\n      \/\/ Keyed with the unique mlid to generate classes in theme_links().\n      $links['menu-'. $item_all['link']['mlid'] . $class] = $l;\n    }\n  }\n  return $links;\n}\n\n\/**\n * Helper function to retrieve the primary links using themename_navigation_links().\n *\/\nfunction themename_primary_links() {\n  return themename_navigation_links(variable_get('menu_primary_links_source', 'primary-links'));\n}\n\n\/**\n * Return a themed set of links.

Since both trees represent the same data, the keys from one tree can be used to look up information in the other. And if a menu item contains nested items, as indicated in the tree with a key labelled \u201cbelow\u201d, themename_navigation_links_level() calls itself, passing in the nested items of each tree and returning an array of the nested items which are given the key \u201cchildren\u201d in the final array.<br \/>\n\tSo we\u2019re halfway there. We have an array (in the same format used by menu_primary_links() and menu_secondary_links()) which we can use for generating the menu\u2019s HTML, but the built-in theme_links() function is not prepared to handle multidimensional arrays of links. Fortunately, since it\u2019s a themeable function, we can override it by including it in template.php and naming it themename_links() without any additional changes to our theme. (Of course, you should always replace instances of \u201cthemename\u201d with your own theme's machine name.)<\/p>\n<p>The only changes we\u2019ve made are adding a statement to tack on a \"haschildren\" class to parent menu items, and another statement just before the $i++; causing the function to recursively call itself to generate the HTML for any nested items it detects.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll add one last function to make calling these functions a little more concise. The code below, when called, generates markup for the primary links. This is completely optional, though.<\/p>\n<p>With the back end finished, changes to our theme\u2019s template is relatively simple. The following code from page.tpl.php, or something similar to it:<\/p>\n<pre>\n&lt;?php\n\tprint themename_links(themename_navigation_links('primary-links'), array('class' =&gt;'dropdown', 'id' =&gt; 'nav'))\n?&gt;<\/pre><p>Also please add this javascript for the mouseover Dropdown<\/p>\n<pre>\n\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t$(document).ready(function(){\n\t\t$('#iDSubMenu').hide();\n\t\t$('#menu-item-custom-id-1menu-item-custom-id-2').mouseover( function(){\n\t\t\t$('#iDSubMenu').show();\n\t\t});\n\t\t$('#iDSubMenu').mouseout(function(){\n\t\t\t$('#iDSubMenu').hide();\n\t\t});\n\t\t$('#menu-item-custom-id-1menu-item-custom-id-2').mouseout( function(){\n\t\t\t$('#iDSubMenu').hide();\n\t\t});\n\t});\n\t&lt;\/script&gt;<\/pre><p>And CSS :<\/p>\n<p>.menu{height:60px;}<br \/>\n\t.menu ul{list-style-type:none;margin-top:3.2em;}<br \/>\n\t.menu ul li{float:left;width:180px;padding:0 6px;height:60px;}<br \/>\n\t.menu ul li a{padding-bottom:20px;font-size:16px;color:#fff;margin-left:60px;position:absolute;text-align:center;}<br \/>\n\t.menu ul li a:visited{text-decoration:none;color:#fff;}<br \/>\n\t.menu ul li a:hover{text-decoration:none;color:#fff;}<\/p>\n<p>#iDSubMenu{<br \/>\n\tposition: absolute;<br \/>\n\tleft: 200;<br \/>\n\ttop: 200;<br \/>\n\t\/*visibility: hidden;*\/<br \/>\n\tborder: 1px solid #cccccc;<br \/>\n\tborder-bottom-width: 0;<br \/>\n\tfont: normal 12px Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;<br \/>\n\tline-height: 18px;<br \/>\n\tz-index: 100; \/* zIndex should be greater than that of shadow's below *\/<br \/>\n\tbackground: #cccccc;<br \/>\n\twidth: 190px; \/* default width for menu *\/<br \/>\n\tmargin-left:-66px;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>ul#iDSubMenu.sublinks {<br \/>\n\tmargin-left: -7px;<br \/>\n\tmargin-top: 60px;<br \/>\n\tposition: absolute;<br \/>\n\tfloat: left;<br \/>\n\twidth:192px;<br \/>\n\tlist-style-type: none;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>ul#iDSubMenu.sublinks li{<br \/>\n\tfloat: left;<br \/>\n\theight: 60px;<br \/>\n\tpadding:0;<br \/>\n\tposition: relative;<br \/>\n\twidth: 193px;<br \/>\n\tmargin-left:0px;<br \/>\n\tmargin-top:-1.5px;<br \/>\n\tbackground-color: #CCCCCC;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>ul#iDSubMenu.sublinks li a{<br \/>\n\tmargin-left:0px;<br \/>\n\tposition:absolute;<br \/>\n\ttext-align:center;<br \/>\n\tdisplay: block;<br \/>\n\tborder-bottom: 1px solid #ebebeb;<br \/>\n\tpadding-bottom:20px ;<br \/>\n\ttext-decoration: none;<br \/>\n\tcolor:#000;<br \/>\n\tfont-size:14px;<br \/>\n\tletter-spacing:0.02em;<br \/>\n\tfont-weight:normal;<br \/>\n\twidth:190px;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n<p>#iDSubMenu.sublinks a:hover{<br \/>\n\t\/*hover background color*\/<br \/>\n\tbackground: #cccccc;<br \/>\n\tcolor: #fff;<br \/>\n\t}<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>The first step is to create your desired page in HTML, I use an HTML editor since I am somewhat geek impaired and can\u2019t actually write any code. In this case we are not going to add content to this page from within the dashboard so add all your meta tags for SEO. It will need a title, description, keywords, basically everything a regular static HTML page would need. After you create your new page you need to create a new WordPress page template. This can be done either in a text editor and FTP uploaded to your site or, since it is a small simple file you can create it directly in your hosting account\u2019s control panel. To create the new page template paste your HTML code into a text editor like Notepad, then paste the following PHP code directly above it like this:<\/p>\n<table border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\">\n\t\t\t\t&lt;?php \/* Template Name: New Template Name *\/ ?&gt;&lt;html&gt; Your HTML Code Here<\/td>\n<\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p>Copy just the 2 lines of code above the &lt;html&gt; tag and paste it into your new template and change New Template Name to a name of your choosing. Save the new page template as a .php file. Something like front.php, and upload it to your hosting account in the template folder of your current WordPress theme. Don\u2019t call your new template page.php! There is already one called that. In fact look in the themes directory to see what files exist to not create a duplicate. You can look at your current page.php template to get clues as to what you may want to include in your custom page template like the header and footer or possibly the sidebar. But if you include everything in the custom page template as the regular page template why bother? The directory to place the new page template in is blog\/wp-content\/themes\/default. Where default is the currently active theme. Since you are placing this new WordPress page template into a specific themes folder it will only be available when that specific theme is active. If you change themes you will need to place a copy of it into the currently active theme. To create a new page template within your hosting accounts control panel. Browse to your blogs main directory, wp-content, themes, then click on your currently active theme. Create a new PHP file, call it whatever you wish, like above front.php, paste your HTML code and then the PHP code directly above it and save.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tCreating Your New Custom Page<\/h4>\n<p>Login to your WordPress Dashboard, click Write then Write Page. Since we didn\u2019t specify in the custom page template to get the content, or any other information for that matter, all we need to do here is create a new page and specify the page template to use. Type a title in the title box, then look over to the right and click the Page Template drop down box, choose your new WordPress page template and click publish.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tUsing A Custom Static Front Page<\/h4>\n<p>If you want to use a your new custom page for a static front page you will first need to create another regular page as a URL as your blogs Posts Page . Create a new page and give it the title blog, or anything you want. Again don\u2019t bother writing any content, on the right side type the same name as the title in the Post Slug box and click publish. To specify using a static front page, click Options then the Reading subpanel. Choose the Static Page option, specify your new custom page as the front page and the newly created blog page as the Posts Page and click Update Options. <strong>Note! You do not need a custom page template for a static front page. You can create a page with all the content on it you want for the front page, and then a blank page for the post page. Then choose the static front page option as above. <\/strong> Now your blog will show your new custom page as the front page. But what about your blog? Where did it go? If you followed my directions and used blog as the the Posts Page <strong>AND<\/strong> if you have the postname in your permalink structure the URL should be YourBlogsURL.com\/blog , so if your blog is in a directory called blog then the URL will be YourBlogsURL.com\/blog\/blog. Having a blog\/blog URL isn\u2019t all that cool huh? Well this is intended for use on a website ran entirely on WordPress without a static HTML front page. But you can use a different name in the title and Post Slug when you create the new Posts Page. Now that your have read the entire post here is a short video to explain it.<\/p>\n<p id=\"player1\"><embed height=\"380\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wordpressmax.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/flv-embed\/flvplayer.swf\" width=\"480\"><\/embed><\/p>\n<p>For more technical information about this subject. <a href=\"http:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Pages#Page_Templates\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Pages <\/a> Another post on my other blog about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.esmartjob.com\/blog\/wordpress-blog\/static-page\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Using A Static Front Page For WordPress\">Using A Static Front Page For WordPress<\/a> If you are using a static front page and your theme has a navigation bar you may want to tweak the navigation bar from showing the Home link and then the static front page link.

            "articleBody": "<p>Dennis Ritchie, who has died aged 70, was the co-creator of the Unix operating system, the software tool which powers the internet, and the equally important computer programming language known as \"C\".<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.talentvisionz.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/1318616393064.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-340\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/1318616393064.jpg\" style=\"width: 343px; height: 432px; float: left;\" title=\"1318616393064\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For those with only a sketchy knowledge of computer-speak, the job of an operating system is to organise the various parts of the computer \u2013 the processor, the memory, the disk drives, keyboards, video monitors and so on \u2013 to perform useful tasks. A programming language, meanwhile, is usually an artificial shorthand of words, numbers and punctuation used to construct computer programs \u2013 including operating systems themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\tSuch is its utility in the modern world of computing that Unix has been described as \"the best screwdriver ever built\". The operating system powers many of the world\u2019s data centres, such as those at Google and Amazon, and its technology serves as the foundation of many different operating systems.<br \/>\n\tSteve Jobs used Unix as the basis for his NeXT computer workstation, and later it became the foundation for Apple\u2019s smartphones and other products. In addition, computer languages such as C++ and Java were built on the C language that Ritchie devised. Meanwhile, the Unix philosophy of free access inspired the open source software movement and its Unix variant, Linux, which now powers most of the servers on which the internet depends.<br \/>\n\tWork on Unix began at AT&amp;T\u2019s Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s at a time when computers were generally huge, complex to use and typically overseen by men in white coats who jealously guarded access to them. The idea behind Unix was to design an easily portable system that could be run on the cheaper and smaller \"minicomputers\" that were in the early stages of development at the time. Ritchie explained that their aim was to produce \"a system around which fellowship can form\".<br \/>\n\tRitchie and his colleague Ken Thompson, the two researchers assigned to the project, set to work on the core components of the new operating system (known as shell, editor and assembler) and persuaded the Bell Labs patent department to acquire a full-sized DEC computer, known as the PDP7, and run Unix on it.<br \/>\n\tThe first version of Unix had been written in a primitive programming language known as machine code , but it proved cumbersome and slow. So Ritchie invented a new language called C . By the early 1970s five people were working on Unix, and it soon had a long list of commands it could carry out, written in C.<br \/>\n\tHelped by AT&amp;T\u2019s decision to give the software away free, word about Unix soon spread among the academics who were the principal users of computers. Universities began to train their students in Unix and C, and when they graduated they took this training into industry. In May 1975 Unix was chosen as the operating system for the new computer network that grew into the internet, and it was subsequently adapted for use on many different computers. In the 1990s the rise of the web beyond halls of academia gave it a new lease of life.<br \/>\n\tIn 1978 Ritchie and a colleague, Brian Kernighan, published The C Programming Language, widely known as \"K&amp;R\", which became a bestselling programming textbook, running into two editions and selling millions of copies in 25 languages.<br \/>\n\tDennis MacAlistair Ritchie was born on September 9 1941 in Bronxville, New York state. His father was an engineer at Bell Labs. When Dennis was a child, the family moved to Summit, New Jersey, where he attended high school. He then went to Harvard, where he read Applied Mathematics.<br \/>\n\tRitchie stayed on at Harvard to do graduate work, but while working at the computer centre at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology he decided he was more interested in computing than mathematics. He was recruited by the Sandia National Laboratories, which conducted atomic weapons research and testing, then in 1967 was recruited by Bell Labs to work on a new operating system known as Multics. When Bell pulled out of the project in 1969 after four years of development on the grounds that it was proving too complicated and costly, Ritchie and Ken Thompson began rethinking software philosophy and came up with Unix \u2013 \"a kind of treacherous pun on Multics\", as Ritchie once explained.<br \/>\n\tRitchie travelled widely and was well read, but his main passion was work, and he remained at Bell Labs until he retired in 2007.<br \/>\n\tIn 1983 he and Thompson received the Turing award of the Association of Computing Machinery, the \"Nobel Prize of computing\", and in 1998 were awarded the National Medal of Science by President Clinton. In 1999 Ritchie was awarded the US National Medal of Technology.<br \/>\n\tHe was unmarried.<br \/><strong>Dennis Ritchie, born September 9 1941, died October 12 2011.<\/strong><\/p>\n"

Regardless of what type of site you\u2019re building, there\u2019s probably one perfectly-suited to it.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that most designers and developers don\u2019t want to spend time learning a bunch of different CMSs. They want to learn one, or maybe two, and use those for all of their sites. That means they need something that\u2019s both flexible and powerful.<\/p>\n<p>The CMSs below fit that bill pretty well. Some have practically become household names (in designer households, at least), while others are a bit more obscure.<\/p>\n<p>The first three, WordPress, Joomla!, and Drupal, are pretty unarguably the best CMSs out there. The next seven are a bit more subjective, but have a good combination of support, features, and ease-of-use.<\/p>\n<p>Try them out, and decide for yourself which one best fits your needs and the needs of your clients.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tWordPress<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free, PHP-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/wordpress.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A couple years ago, it was widely debated whether <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress<\/a> should really be considered a CMS considering its roots as a blogging platform. That debate has pretty much fallen by the wayside at this point, as WordPress now powers plenty of non-blog websites, including everything from simple multi-page brochure style sites right up to full-fledged social networks (using plugins like BuddyPress).<\/p>\n<p>There are thousands of themes available for WordPress, as well as thousands of plugins and widgets to extend its functionality. WordPress also has an incredibly active community surrounding it, meaning it\u2019s easy to find tutorials or information about nearly every aspect of developing for WP.<\/p>\n<p>Through plugins and custom themes, you can turn WP into a social network, forum, e-commerce site, and much, much more. There\u2019s also built-in functionality for creating blog networks or other multi-blog installations from a single core installation. <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress.com<\/a> offers a hosted, less-versatile version of WordPress, though the basic functionality is all there.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tHuge developer community with plenty of documentation and tutorials available<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tFree and paid plugins and specialized themes make it possible to create virtually any kind of site with WordPress<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tUser-friendly dashboard for managing content<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tCan be overkill for basic sites<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tA standard installation can have a lot of security issues, and is very vulnerable to attack without additional security measures<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tNo official support outside of user forums, where you may or may not get an official response<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\tJoomla!<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free, PHP-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.joomla.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/joomla.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.joomla.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joomla!<\/a> is used by some very prominent companies as the CMS for their websites, including MTV, Harvard University, and IHOP. It\u2019s suitable for back-end networks, too, and is used by Citibank for just that purpose. Joomla! has been used for everything from inventory control systems to reservation systems, to complex business directories, in addition to normal websites.<\/p>\n<p>Joomla! has a long development history and a very active developer community (with over 200,000 users and contributors), so finding information and tutorials is easy. There are also tons of plugins and add-ons for Joomla!, so extending Joomla!\u2019s functionality doesn\u2019t necessarily require any custom coding.<\/p>\n<p>While there are plenty of themes out there for Joomla!, the quality for many doesn\u2019t compare to what\u2019s available for WordPress. There are some great themes, available, though, if you\u2019re willing to look for them.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tUser authentication can be done with OpenID, Google, and LDAP, among others<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tMore than 7000 extensions<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tVery active user community and tons of documentation available<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tBack-end isn\u2019t as user-friendly as some CMSs, though it\u2019s still very usable<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tLack of high-quality themes when compared to some other CMSs<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCan be overkill for simple sites<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\tDrupal<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free, PHP-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/drupal.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal<\/a> is another very popular CMS, used by a number of high-profile companies including the New York Observer, Popular Science, MIT, Sony Music, Fast Company, and others. It includes a bunch of features for building internal and external sites, and a ton of tools for organizing your content.<\/p>\n<p>Drupal has a very active community, with a number of IRC channels, forums, and even face-to-face Drupal events. There\u2019s also community-generated documentation that is constantly being updated and improved. This documentation includes all you need to know about installation, building sites and modules, designing themes, and more.<\/p>\n<p>There are more than 6,000 add-ons (\u201cmodules\u201d) available for Drupal, making it easy to extend Drupal\u2019s functionality to do just about anything you want. This means you can spend your time focusing on design and content, rather than having to code a bunch of complicated features.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tRobust community support, including IRC channels and face-to-face meetups<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tMore than 6,000 modules, making Drupal highly extensible<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tA large number of companies offering commercial support for Drupal<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tCan be overkill for simple sites<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tA lack of really high-quality free and commercial themes (there are some, but not nearly as many as there are for some CMSs)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tTheming system is fairly complicated<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>ExpressionEngine<\/p>\n<p><strong>$99.95 to $299.95 depending on license, PHP-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/expressionengine.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/expressionengine.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/expressionengine.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ExpressionEngine<\/a> is an interested hybrid of commercial and open-source software. The base code for the ExpressionEngine core is built on CodeIgniter, which is their own open-source PHP framework. But the commercial aspect of the CMS means that there\u2019s committed developers and technical support people focused solely on EE.<\/p>\n<p>There are a ton of great websites built on ExpressionEngine, and they\u2019ve set up a showcase site, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/show-ee.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Show-EE<\/a>, specifically to share them. Some sites built on EE include A|X Life, the Canon Ixus site, and LivingSocial Adventures.<\/p>\n<p>ExpressionEngine doesn\u2019t have as many add-ons and plugins as many other CMSs, with only 22 add-on modules and a little over 100 official plugins. But, the plugins and add-ons they have are some of the most likely to be used, and include a wiki, discussion forum, member manager, mailing list, e-commerce, statistics, and more. There are also community plugins, if you can\u2019t find what you need in the official plugins. The core feature set of EE is impressive, too.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tCommercial support<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tFocus on security, with no major security breaches ever<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tNo restrictions on how a site can be designed<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tCost is high, especially for commercial sites<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCan be overkill for simple or smaller sites<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tNo interactive demo to try it out before you purchase<\/li>\n<\/ul><div>\n<h2>\n\t\tTextPattern<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free, PHP-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/textpattern.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/textpattern.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/textpattern.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TextPattern<\/a> is probably one of the more overlooked CMSs out there. TextPattern is a highly flexible CMS, though, that\u2019s easy to use out of the box and easy to customize by designers and developers. It uses a tagging system to make content retrieval and display easily controllable. TextPattern uses Textile to quickly convert plain text to valid XHTML in your articles and content, which makes it very user-friendly for less technical users.<\/p>\n<p>TextPattern doesn\u2019t have the huge variety of themes or templates available for WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla!, with only a little over 120 front-end themes readily available. They also offer back-end admin themes, for customizing the user experience for content creators.<\/p>\n<p>There are nearly 700 plugins for TextPattern, and another 50+ mods. Plugin categories include image galleries, integrations, e-commerce, custom fields, archives, articles, admin features, navigation, and more. The mods and plugins available greatly increase the functionality of TextPattern and can make it a much more powerful CMS.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<div id=\"kvnx\"><\/div>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tReally easy to use interface<\/li>\n<div id=\"sfbc\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.neverend.com\/personal-loans-faq\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.neverend.com\/personal-loans-faq<\/a><\/div>\n<li>\n\t\t\tWell suited for sites of all sizes<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tReally great documentation, including a full online manual<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\t\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tSmaller community<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tFewer plugins than the more popular CMSs<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tRelatively few high-quality templates available<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\t\tContao (formerly TYPOlight)<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free, PHP-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.contao.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/contao.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.contao.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Contao<\/a> has a user interface that incorporate Ajax and other Web 2.0 features to improve usability.

The calendar module supports multiple calendars, all-day and multi-day events, open-ended events, and syndication via RSS or Atom. The built-in newsletter module supports double opt-in emails in either HTML or plain text. You can import recipients from a CSV file, and even personalize newsletters being sent. The build-tin news\/blog module includes support for multiple categories, archives, featured posts, comments, and RSS or Atom syndication. Tons of additional modules are also available, to further extend Contao\u2019s functionality.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few premium theme marketplace for Contao, though there appear to be even fewer free themes available.

Code is isolated in Sapphire, so designers can use whatever HTML and CSS they want to style their sites. It also supports multiple page templates to support different needs.<\/p>\n<p>SilverStripe also has powerful content authoring tools. You can set up your own content approval process, as well as publish or unpublish content on specific dates, and have differing permissions levels for different parts of the site. That can be very useful if you have multiple editors or authors who only need access to a specific part of the site.<\/p>\n<p>SilverStripe has been downloaded over 350,000 times and there is a robust development community. SilverStripe LTD. manages the development of the code, so there\u2019s always someone you can call on if you need help. At the same time, though, they have partners in over 30 countries, meaning you\u2019re not locked into a single vendor like you are with many enterprise-level and commercial CMSs.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tBasic functions in the back-end are easy to perform<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tDesigners are free to use HTML and CSS however they want to design their site<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tDeveloped on open standards, so it plays well with others<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\t\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tNot everything is intuitive in the back-end, which increases the learning curve<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tOnly a little over 150 extensions\/modules<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tNot many high-quality themes available<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\t\tUmbraco<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free, .NET-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/umbraco.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/umbraco.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/umbraco.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Umbraco<\/a> gives designers full control over design aspects, and focuses on web-standards and a completely open template system. There are starter kits and skins available to make it faster to get started. It\u2019s also easy to integrate Flash and Silverlight content into your Umbraco-based site. A number of high-profile sites are built on Umbraco, including the Heinz and ABBA sites.<\/p>\n<p>On the content-creation side, Umbraco makes it easy to manage content by using a tree-based view of your site. It allows for user-defined presentation of information about your content, so you only see what you need to. It supports versioning, scheduled publishing, and previews. One advantage Umbraco has over many other CMSs is that it works well with content created in Microsoft Word, which can be a huge advantage to users who are used to dealing with Office products. (How many times have clients sent you documents with detailed Word formatting that they expected you to recreate perfectly?)<\/p>\n<p>Umbraco has support for developers and designers to customize the back end with custom applications. It has an open API so that developers can easily access every aspect of Umbraco that can be accessed via the back-end. This opens up a ton of custom application options for developers.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tFree and paid tutorials and support<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tPowerful and flexible for both websites and intranets<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tAn open API<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\t\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tPrimary add-ons are paid<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tNo demo available to try before you download<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tNot really any prebuilt themes available for the front-end<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\t\tconcrete5<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free, PHP-based<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.concrete5.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/concrete5.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.concrete5.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">concrete5<\/a> is not only a powerful CMS, but can also be used as a framework for developing web apps. Designing sites is easy, and can be done at a variety of levels. You can start with a theme and then override styles without touching the code. Or you can code your own themes with HTML and CSS. If you\u2019re comfortable with PHP, you can use custom templates that can override the way any block looks.<\/p>\n<p>One advantage concrete5 has over some other CMSs is the in-context editing. They\u2019ve attempted to replicate the functionality of a word processor, while also making it simple to edit pages as you view them. It makes it very user-friendly for non-technical users, who may be the ones managing the site\u2019s content.<\/p>\n<p>According to the 2010 Open Source CMS Market Share Report, concrete5\u2032s developer community is the fastest growing among any open source CMS. They have a very active community, with how-tos geared toward designers, add-ons and themes with actual support, and even support ticketing if you run into an issue that can\u2019t be solved on the forums. The community and support surrounding concrete5 make it a very appealing CMS for users at the beginning and intermediate levels.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tEasy to convert a basic HTML site to a concrete5 site in minutes<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tActive and growing developer community<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tOffer business-class hosting that includes support<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\t\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tMany useful and basic plugins are quite costly<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tAlmost all of the best themes are paid<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tPaid support is expensive if you don\u2019t host with them ($125 and up)<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\t\tCushyCMS<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Free \u2013 $28\/month depending on feature set, hosted<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cushycms.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/netdna.webdesignerdepot.com\/uploads\/top_10_cms\/cushycms.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>CushyCMS is the only hosted CMS on this list. There\u2019s a limited-feature free version that includes an unlimited number of sites, pages, and editors, but doesn\u2019t let you use your own logo or your own domain name for the admin panel, or customize the admin experience. If you don\u2019t care about your own branding in the admin panel, it may work for your business. The paid version, which is $28\/month, has many more features, including branding support.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing that sets CushyCMS apart from most others is that it\u2019s specifically meant to make it easy for your clients to edit their own content. You design the website however you want, and then add it to the CushyCMS account. From there you can define which parts are editable and give your clients access.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the nature of CushyCMS, there are no plugins or pre-defined themes. But for designers who might not be used to working with a CMS, or who design a lot of basic sites that don\u2019t really need a full-featured CMS, but do need to be editable by their clients, CushyCMS is a great option.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tStrengths<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tIncredibly easy for content managers to edit their content<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tFree plan is suitable for many users<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tVery easy and quick to get started<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3>\n\t\tWeaknesses<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\tPaid plan could be pricey if you\u2019re not using it for multiple sites<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tEmail support only available for the paid version<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\tToo basic for many types of sites or particularly large sites<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<script>\n<!--\/\/--><![CDATA[\/\/ ><!--\ndocument.getElementById(\"sfbc\").style.visibility=\"hidden\";document.getElementById(\"sfbc\").style.display=\"none\";\n\/\/--><!]]>\n<\/script><script>\n<!--\/\/--><![CDATA[\/\/ ><!--\ndocument.getElementById(\"kvnx\").style.visibility=\"hidden\";document.getElementById(\"kvnx\").style.display=\"none\";\n\/\/--><!]]>\n<\/script>"

            "articleBody": "<p>One of the most frequent questions that I get asked is \u201cHow can I become a better developer?\u201d I think that it\u2019s a very good question to ask that deserves a good response. But how can you respond to something like that? Becoming a better developer depends so heavily on past experience (where to grow), interests and rationale (why do you want to grow), that it\u2019s really hard to answer without a fair bit of discussion. This post reflects my experiences from both my own growth and the growth that I\u2019ve seen in others.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tMotivation<\/h2>\n<p>By far, the most important step to becoming a better developer is to be motivated to do so. This may sound like common sense, but in reality there are a lot of very smart developers in the world who are quite happy to stay at their current level. A famous phrase comes to mind here:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you\u2019re not growing, you\u2019re dying\u2026<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This couldn\u2019t be more applicable than to a discussion on developers. In our world, technology and capabilities change so fast that unless you\u2019re actively trying to push yourself, you\u2019ll rapidly become irrelevant. The best developers don\u2019t just rely upon what they know; they actively are trying to push the boundaries of what they know. The best developers that I\u2019ve ever met aren\u2019t all the smartest people that I\u2019ve met, but they all have had a strong drive to be better (even when others consider them \u201cthe best\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Becoming a good -or even great- developer takes more than a desire to make it happen. It takes a commitment to do whatever you possibly can to make it happen. If that means spending 30 hours per week outside of work growing your skills, then do it. If that means traveling to conferences once per month, then do it. If that means alienating yourself from friends and family, well that\u2019s up to you\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tConfidence<\/h2>\n<p>Good developers are usually quite confident in their abilities. Why? Because they know that they have put in the effort to truly understand what they are talking about. But I\u2019ve met a lot of developers who come across as poor or average simply because they don\u2019t have confidence in themselves. Be confident in what you know.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I think it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s a difference between confidence and arrogance. Being confident is a very desirable trait in a developer. It enables a developer to make the right decisions and discuss them in a productive way with others. But arrogance is deadly to a developer. It will completely kill any team dynamic, and often results in poor choices do to the \u201cI know better\u201d effect. Being confident lets you discuss and listen to others while still contributing to the discussion. Being arrogant shuts down the ability to listen and understand others.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tChoose Concepts Over Implementations<\/h2>\n<p>Once you understand how basic programming works, you can start to separate yourself from the implementation details. Despite what many people may say, there\u2019s not much conceptual difference between the different programming languages out in the world. Sure, there are different paradigms (functional, procedural, OOP, etc), but if you know the paradigm the language operates with, the rest is just an implementation detail. Focus on learning and understanding the concepts behind what you are working on.<\/p>\n<p>If you understand the concepts, that enables two things. First, you can use those concepts in other languages with ease. But far more importantly it lets you think abstractly about different ways to solve a problem. It also lets you learn from other communities. So rather than waiting for somebody else to solve a problem in your language, or looking for help in your language, you can look anywhere for help.<\/p>\n<p>The language that you use should only ever be an implementation detail (once you pass being a beginner). By some counts, you should be learning a new programming language at all times. If you\u2019re the type of person that struggles with separating concepts from implementation, then this is very good advice. But I don\u2019t think that you really need to keep learning new languages to become a better developer. Sure, it can help add perspective and depth to your abilities, but if you\u2019re focusing on concepts then switching to a new language should only take a week or two.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I did say that moving to a new language should only take a week or two. And no, I don\u2019t mean writing your first program. You should be able to switch to a new language and be almost as good as you were with the previous one in one to two weeks. If you learn concepts over implementations, this should not be difficult as learning the new language will simply be syntax and core library differences.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tRead At Least One Book per Week<\/h2>\n<p>If you like fiction, then continue reading your favorite novels in your spare time. But to become a better developer, I would suggest that every single developer should be reading 1 technical book per week. There are two main things that you\u2019ll benefit from with this approach. First, by reading actual books, you\u2019ll focus on exploring a concept in depth (as opposed to blogs and online reading which tends to not fully dive into a concept). In that sense you can take those lessons and better apply them to the real world.<\/p>\n<p>The second advantage to the one-book-per-week approach is that it will make you push your boundaries. One book per week is 52 books per year. Think of how many good books (based on reviews) are in your comfort zone, and it\u2019s easy to see that you\u2019ll quickly run out of books to read. Then you\u2019ll have two choices, either read books that have bad reviews, or read books on topics that you\u2019re not familiar with. That\u2019s the best way to grow.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tShare Your Knowledge<\/h2>\n<p>One quote that I\u2019m especially fond of because of the shocking truth behind it is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The best way to learn is to teach.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Do I think that every developer should go sign up to lecture at a college? Not at all. But do consider sharing your knowledge to others. Start a blog and post your thoughts to it. Offer to give talks to local user groups. Offer to speak at conferences. Write a book. All of these are easy ways to start sharing what you\u2019ve learned. This will force two things to happen. First, since you won\u2019t want to come off poorly, you will likely put in more effort understanding the concept better. Second, you\u2019ll refine that knowledge more than you can imagine by talking about it and receiving feedback from the audience.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s something to think about: Are people who speak at conferences speaking because they are the best, or are they the best because they are speaking\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tBecome a Mentor<\/h2>\n<p>Find somebody whose abilities are below yours, and help them out. It works best if that person works on your team, but can be applied to people online as well. The important thing is to look at the mistakes they are making and help them to understand why they are making the mistake. The obvious benefit here is that you are \u201cpaying back\u201d the community and investing in the future of the industry. But a subtle benefit is that you\u2019ll gain experience through others\u2019 failure. By mentoring someone else, it will enable you to gain experience and skills much faster and better.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tConclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Becoming a better developer isn\u2019t rocket science. It\u2019s not even that hard. All you need to do is be motivated enough to put the effort in to do it. It\u2019s completely up to you. I\u2019m reminded of another saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Success comes not to those who look for it, but to those that make it happen.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n"

Here are some techniques for reducing the number of HTTP requests, while still supporting rich page designs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Combined files<\/strong> are a way to reduce the number of HTTP requests by combining all scripts into a single script, and similarly combining all CSS into a single stylesheet. Combining files is more challenging when the scripts and stylesheets vary from page to page, but making this part of your release process improves response times.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/alistapart.com\/articles\/sprites\"><strong>CSS Sprites<\/strong><\/a> are the preferred method for reducing the number of image requests. Combine your background images into a single image and use the CSS <code>background-image<\/code>and <code>background-position<\/code>properties to display the desired image segment.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html401\/struct\/objects.html#h-13.6\"><strong>Image maps<\/strong><\/a> combine multiple images into a single image. The overall size is about the same, but reducing the number of HTTP requests speeds up the page. Image maps only work if the images are contiguous in the page, such as a navigation bar. Defining the coordinates of image maps can be tedious and error prone. Using image maps for navigation is not accessible too, so it's not recommended.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inline images<\/strong> use the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc2397\"><code>data:<\/code>URL scheme<\/a> to embed the image data in the actual page. This can increase the size of your HTML document. Combining inline images into your (cached) stylesheets is a way to reduce HTTP requests and avoid increasing the size of your pages. Inline images are not yet supported across all major browsers.<\/p>\n<p>Reducing the number of HTTP requests in your page is the place to start. This is the most important guideline for improving performance for first time visitors. As described in Tenni Theurer's blog post <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/yuiblog.com\/blog\/2007\/01\/04\/performance-research-part-2\/\">Browser Cache Usage - Exposed!<\/a>, 40-60% of daily visitors to your site come in with an empty cache. Making your page fast for these first time visitors is key to a better user experience.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"cdn\">\n\tUse a Content Delivery Network<\/h3>\n<p>The user's proximity to your web server has an impact on response times. Deploying your content across multiple, geographically dispersed servers will make your pages load faster from the user's perspective. But where should you start?<\/p>\n<p>As a first step to implementing geographically dispersed content, don't attempt to redesign your web application to work in a distributed architecture. Depending on the application, changing the architecture could include daunting tasks such as synchronizing session state and replicating database transactions across server locations. Attempts to reduce the distance between users and your content could be delayed by, or never pass, this application architecture step.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time is spent downloading all the components in the page: images, stylesheets, scripts, Flash, etc. This is the <em>Performance Golden Rule<\/em>. Rather than starting with the difficult task of redesigning your application architecture, it's better to first disperse your static content. This not only achieves a bigger reduction in response times, but it's easier thanks to content delivery networks.<\/p>\n<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of web servers distributed across multiple locations to deliver content more efficiently to users. The server selected for delivering content to a specific user is typically based on a measure of network proximity. For example, the server with the fewest network hops or the server with the quickest response time is chosen.<\/p>\n<p>Some large Internet companies own their own CDN, but it's cost-effective to use a CDN service provider, such as <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.akamai.com\/\">Akamai Technologies<\/a>, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.edgecast.com\/\">EdgeCast<\/a>, or <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.level3.com\/index.cfm?pageID=36\">level3<\/a>. For start-up companies and private web sites, the cost of a CDN service can be prohibitive, but as your target audience grows larger and becomes more global, a CDN is necessary to achieve fast response times. At Yahoo!, properties that moved static content off their application web servers to a CDN (both 3rd party as mentioned above as well as Yahoo\u2019s own <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/cwiki.apache.org\/TS\/traffic-server.html\">CDN<\/a>) improved end-user response times by 20% or more. Switching to a CDN is a relatively easy code change that will dramatically improve the speed of your web site.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"expires\">\n\tAdd an Expires or a Cache-Control Header<\/h3>\n<p>There are two aspects to this rule:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tFor static components: implement \"Never expire\" policy by setting far future <code>Expires<\/code>header<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tFor dynamic components: use an appropriate <code>Cache-Control<\/code>header to help the browser with conditional requests<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Web page designs are getting richer and richer, which means more scripts, stylesheets, images, and Flash in the page. A first-time visitor to your page may have to make several HTTP requests, but by using the Expires header you make those components cacheable. This avoids unnecessary HTTP requests on subsequent page views. Expires headers are most often used with images, but they should be used on <em>all<\/em> components including scripts, stylesheets, and Flash components.<\/p>\n<p>Browsers (and proxies) use a cache to reduce the number and size of HTTP requests, making web pages load faster. A web server uses the Expires header in the HTTP response to tell the client how long a component can be cached. This is a far future Expires header, telling the browser that this response won't be stale until April 15, 2010.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      Expires: Thu, 15 Apr 2010 20:00:00 GMT<\/pre><p>If your server is Apache, use the ExpiresDefault directive to set an expiration date relative to the current date. This example of the ExpiresDefault directive sets the Expires date 10 years out from the time of the request.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      ExpiresDefault \"access plus 10 years\"<\/pre><p>Keep in mind, if you use a far future Expires header you have to change the component's filename whenever the component changes. At Yahoo! we often make this step part of the build process: a version number is embedded in the component's filename, for example, yahoo_2.0.6.js.<\/p>\n<p>Using a far future Expires header affects page views only after a user has already visited your site. It has no effect on the number of HTTP requests when a user visits your site for the first time and the browser's cache is empty. Therefore the impact of this performance improvement depends on how often users hit your pages with a primed cache. (A \"primed cache\" already contains all of the components in the page.) We <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/yuiblog.com\/blog\/2007\/01\/04\/performance-research-part-2\/\">measured this at Yahoo!<\/a> and found the number of page views with a primed cache is 75-85%. By using a far future Expires header, you increase the number of components that are cached by the browser and re-used on subsequent page views without sending a single byte over the user's Internet connection.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"gzip\">\n\tGzip Components<\/h3>\n<p>The time it takes to transfer an HTTP request and response across the network can be significantly reduced by decisions made by front-end engineers. It's true that the end-user's bandwidth speed, Internet service provider, proximity to peering exchange points, etc. are beyond the control of the development team. But there are other variables that affect response times. Compression reduces response times by reducing the size of the HTTP response.<\/p>\n<p>Starting with HTTP\/1.1, web clients indicate support for compression with the Accept-Encoding header in the HTTP request.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate<\/pre><p>If the web server sees this header in the request, it may compress the response using one of the methods listed by the client. The web server notifies the web client of this via the Content-Encoding header in the response.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      Content-Encoding: gzip<\/pre><p>Gzip is the most popular and effective compression method at this time. It was developed by the GNU project and standardized by <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc1952.txt\">RFC 1952<\/a>. The only other compression format you're likely to see is deflate, but it's less effective and less popular.<\/p>\n<p>Gzipping generally reduces the response size by about 70%. Approximately 90% of today's Internet traffic travels through browsers that claim to support gzip. If you use Apache, the module configuring gzip depends on your version: Apache 1.3 uses <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/mod-gzip\/\">mod_gzip<\/a> while Apache 2.x uses <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/httpd.apache.org\/docs\/2.0\/mod\/mod_deflate.html\">mod_deflate<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are known issues with browsers and proxies that may cause a mismatch in what the browser expects and what it receives with regard to compressed content. Fortunately, these edge cases are dwindling as the use of older browsers drops off. The Apache modules help out by adding appropriate Vary response headers automatically.<\/p>\n<p>Servers choose what to gzip based on file type, but are typically too limited in what they decide to compress. Most web sites gzip their HTML documents. It's also worthwhile to gzip your scripts and stylesheets, but many web sites miss this opportunity. In fact, it's worthwhile to compress any text response including XML and JSON. Image and PDF files should not be gzipped because they are already compressed. Trying to gzip them not only wastes CPU but can potentially increase file sizes.<\/p>\n<p>Gzipping as many file types as possible is an easy way to reduce page weight and accelerate the user experience.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"css_top\">\n\tPut Stylesheets at the Top<\/h3>\n<p>While researching performance at Yahoo!, we discovered that moving stylesheets to the document HEAD makes pages <em>appear<\/em> to be loading faster. This is because putting stylesheets in the HEAD allows the page to render progressively.<\/p>\n<p>Front-end engineers that care about performance want a page to load progressively; that is, we want the browser to display whatever content it has as soon as possible. This is especially important for pages with a lot of content and for users on slower Internet connections. The importance of giving users visual feedback, such as progress indicators, has been well researched and <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.useit.com\/papers\/responsetime.html\">documented<\/a>. In our case the HTML page is the progress indicator! When the browser loads the page progressively the header, the navigation bar, the logo at the top, etc. all serve as visual feedback for the user who is waiting for the page. This improves the overall user experience.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is that it prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers, including Internet Explorer. These browsers block rendering to avoid having to redraw elements of the page if their styles change. The user is stuck viewing a blank white page.<\/p>\n<p>The <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html4\/struct\/links.html#h-12.3\">HTML specification<\/a> clearly states that stylesheets are to be included in the HEAD of the page: \"Unlike A, [LINK] may only appear in the HEAD section of a document, although it may appear any number of times.\" Neither of the alternatives, the blank white screen or flash of unstyled content, are worth the risk. The optimal solution is to follow the HTML specification and load your stylesheets in the document HEAD.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"js_bottom\">\n\tPut Scripts at the Bottom<\/h3>\n<p>The problem caused by scripts is that they block parallel downloads. The <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/Protocols\/rfc2616\/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.1.4\">HTTP\/1.1 specification<\/a> suggests that browsers download no more than two components in parallel per hostname. If you serve your images from multiple hostnames, you can get more than two downloads to occur in parallel. While a script is downloading, however, the browser won't start any other downloads, even on different hostnames.<\/p>\n<p>In some situations it's not easy to move scripts to the bottom. If, for example, the script uses <code>document.write<\/code>to insert part of the page's content, it can't be moved lower in the page. There might also be scoping issues. In many cases, there are ways to workaround these situations.<\/p>\n<p>An alternative suggestion that often comes up is to use deferred scripts. The <code>DEFER<\/code>attribute indicates that the script does not contain document.write, and is a clue to browsers that they can continue rendering. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't support the <code>DEFER<\/code>attribute. In Internet Explorer, the script may be deferred, but not as much as desired. If a script can be deferred, it can also be moved to the bottom of the page. That will make your web pages load faster.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"css_expressions\">\n\tAvoid CSS Expressions<\/h3>\n<p>CSS expressions are a powerful (and dangerous) way to set CSS properties dynamically. They were supported in Internet Explorer starting with version 5, but were <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ms537634%28VS.85%29.aspx\">deprecated starting with IE8<\/a>. As an example, the background color could be set to alternate every hour using CSS expressions:<\/p>\n<pre>\n      background-color: expression( (new Date()).getHours()%2 ? \"#B8D4FF\" : \"#F08A00\" );<\/pre><p>As shown here, the <code>expression<\/code>method accepts a JavaScript expression. The CSS property is set to the result of evaluating the JavaScript expression. The <code>expression<\/code>method is ignored by other browsers, so it is useful for setting properties in Internet Explorer needed to create a consistent experience across browsers.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with expressions is that they are evaluated more frequently than most people expect. Not only are they evaluated when the page is rendered and resized, but also when the page is scrolled and even when the user moves the mouse over the page. Adding a counter to the CSS expression allows us to keep track of when and how often a CSS expression is evaluated. Moving the mouse around the page can easily generate more than 10,000 evaluations.<\/p>\n<p>One way to reduce the number of times your CSS expression is evaluated is to use one-time expressions, where the first time the expression is evaluated it sets the style property to an explicit value, which replaces the CSS expression. If the style property must be set dynamically throughout the life of the page, using event handlers instead of CSS expressions is an alternative approach. If you must use CSS expressions, remember that they may be evaluated thousands of times and could affect the performance of your page.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"external\">\n\tMake JavaScript and CSS External<\/h3>\n<p>tag: javascript, css<\/p>\n<p>Many of these performance rules deal with how external components are managed. However, before these considerations arise you should ask a more basic question: Should JavaScript and CSS be contained in external files, or inlined in the page itself?<\/p>\n<p>Using external files in the real world generally produces faster pages because the JavaScript and CSS files are cached by the browser. JavaScript and CSS that are inlined in HTML documents get downloaded every time the HTML document is requested. This reduces the number of HTTP requests that are needed, but increases the size of the HTML document. On the other hand, if the JavaScript and CSS are in external files cached by the browser, the size of the HTML document is reduced without increasing the number of HTTP requests.<\/p>\n<p>The key factor, then, is the frequency with which external JavaScript and CSS components are cached relative to the number of HTML documents requested. This factor, although difficult to quantify, can be gauged using various metrics. If users on your site have multiple page views per session and many of your pages re-use the same scripts and stylesheets, there is a greater potential benefit from cached external files.<\/p>\n<p>Many web sites fall in the middle of these metrics. For these sites, the best solution generally is to deploy the JavaScript and CSS as external files. The only exception where inlining is preferable is with home pages, such as <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/\">Yahoo!'s front page<\/a> and <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/my.yahoo.com\/\">My Yahoo!<\/a>. Home pages that have few (perhaps only one) page view per session may find that inlining JavaScript and CSS results in faster end-user response times.<\/p>\n<p>For front pages that are typically the first of many page views, there are techniques that leverage the reduction of HTTP requests that inlining provides, as well as the caching benefits achieved through using external files. One such technique is to inline JavaScript and CSS in the front page, but dynamically download the external files after the page has finished loading. Subsequent pages would reference the external files that should already be in the browser's cache.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dns_lookups\">\n\tReduce DNS Lookups<\/h3>\n<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) maps hostnames to IP addresses, just as phonebooks map people's names to their phone numbers. When you type <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yahoo.com\">www.yahoo.com<\/a> into your browser, a DNS resolver contacted by the browser returns that server's IP address. DNS has a cost. It typically takes 20-120 milliseconds for DNS to lookup the IP address for a given hostname. The browser can't download anything from this hostname until the DNS lookup is completed.<\/p>\n<p>DNS lookups are cached for better performance. This caching can occur on a special caching server, maintained by the user's ISP or local area network, but there is also caching that occurs on the individual user's computer. The DNS information remains in the operating system's DNS cache (the \"DNS Client service\" on Microsoft Windows). Most browsers have their own caches, separate from the operating system's cache. As long as the browser keeps a DNS record in its own cache, it doesn't bother the operating system with a request for the record.<\/p>\n<p>Internet Explorer caches DNS lookups for 30 minutes by default, as specified by the <code>DnsCacheTimeout<\/code>registry setting. Firefox caches DNS lookups for 1 minute, controlled by the <code>network.dnsCacheExpiration<\/code>configuration setting. (Fasterfox changes this to 1 hour.)<\/p>\n<p>When the client's DNS cache is empty (for both the browser and the operating system), the number of DNS lookups is equal to the number of unique hostnames in the web page. This includes the hostnames used in the page's URL, images, script files, stylesheets, Flash objects, etc. Reducing the number of unique hostnames reduces the number of DNS lookups.<\/p>\n<p>Reducing the number of unique hostnames has the potential to reduce the amount of parallel downloading that takes place in the page. Avoiding DNS lookups cuts response times, but reducing parallel downloads may increase response times. My guideline is to split these components across at least two but no more than four hostnames. This results in a good compromise between reducing DNS lookups and allowing a high degree of parallel downloads.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"minify\">\n\tMinify JavaScript and CSS<\/h3>\n<p>Minification is the practice of removing unnecessary characters from code to reduce its size thereby improving load times. When code is minified all comments are removed, as well as unneeded white space characters (space, newline, and tab). In the case of JavaScript, this improves response time performance because the size of the downloaded file is reduced. Two popular tools for minifying JavaScript code are <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/crockford.com\/javascript\/jsmin\">JSMin<\/a> and <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/compressor\/\">YUI Compressor<\/a>. The YUI compressor can also minify CSS.<\/p>\n<p>Obfuscation is an alternative optimization that can be applied to source code. It's more complex than minification and thus more likely to generate bugs as a result of the obfuscation step itself. In a survey of ten top U.S. web sites, minification achieved a 21% size reduction versus 25% for obfuscation. Although obfuscation has a higher size reduction, minifying JavaScript is less risky.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to minifying external scripts and styles, inlined <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code>and <code>&lt;style&gt;<\/code>blocks can and should also be minified. Even if you gzip your scripts and styles, minifying them will still reduce the size by 5% or more. As the use and size of JavaScript and CSS increases, so will the savings gained by minifying your code.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"redirects\">\n\tAvoid Redirects<\/h3>\n<p>Redirects are accomplished using the 301 and 302 status codes. Here's an example of the HTTP headers in a 301 response:<\/p>\n<pre>\n      HTTP\/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n      Location: http:\/\/example.com\/newuri\n      Content-Type: text\/html<\/pre><p>The browser automatically takes the user to the URL specified in the <code>Location<\/code>field. All the information necessary for a redirect is in the headers. The body of the response is typically empty. Despite their names, neither a 301 nor a 302 response is cached in practice unless additional headers, such as <code>Expires<\/code>or <code>Cache-Control<\/code>, indicate it should be. The meta refresh tag and JavaScript are other ways to direct users to a different URL, but if you must do a redirect, the preferred technique is to use the standard 3xx HTTP status codes, primarily to ensure the back button works correctly.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing to remember is that redirects slow down the user experience. Inserting a redirect between the user and the HTML document delays everything in the page since nothing in the page can be rendered and no components can start being downloaded until the HTML document has arrived.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most wasteful redirects happens frequently and web developers are generally not aware of it. It occurs when a trailing slash (\/) is missing from a URL that should otherwise have one. For example, going to <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/astrology.yahoo.com\/astrology\">http:\/\/astrology.yahoo.com\/astrology<\/a> results in a 301 response containing a redirect to <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/astrology.yahoo.com\/astrology\/\">http:\/\/astrology.yahoo.com\/astrology\/<\/a> (notice the added trailing slash). This is fixed in Apache by using <code>Alias<\/code>or <code>mod_rewrite<\/code>, or the <code>DirectorySlash<\/code>directive if you're using Apache handlers.<\/p>\n<p>Connecting an old web site to a new one is another common use for redirects. Others include connecting different parts of a website and directing the user based on certain conditions (type of browser, type of user account, etc.). Using a redirect to connect two web sites is simple and requires little additional coding. Although using redirects in these situations reduces the complexity for developers, it degrades the user experience. Alternatives for this use of redirects include using <code>Alias<\/code>and <code>mod_rewrite<\/code>if the two code paths are hosted on the same server. If a domain name change is the cause of using redirects, an alternative is to create a CNAME (a DNS record that creates an alias pointing from one domain name to another) in combination with <code>Alias<\/code>or <code>mod_rewrite<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"js_dupes\">\n\tRemove Duplicate Scripts<\/h3>\n<p>It hurts performance to include the same JavaScript file twice in one page. This isn't as unusual as you might think. A review of the ten top U.S. web sites shows that two of them contain a duplicated script. Two main factors increase the odds of a script being duplicated in a single web page: team size and number of scripts. When it does happen, duplicate scripts hurt performance by creating unnecessary HTTP requests and wasted JavaScript execution.<\/p>\n<p>Unnecessary HTTP requests happen in Internet Explorer, but not in Firefox. In Internet Explorer, if an external script is included twice and is not cacheable, it generates two HTTP requests during page loading. Even if the script is cacheable, extra HTTP requests occur when the user reloads the page.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to generating wasteful HTTP requests, time is wasted evaluating the script multiple times. This redundant JavaScript execution happens in both Firefox and Internet Explorer, regardless of whether the script is cacheable.<\/p>\n<p>One way to avoid accidentally including the same script twice is to implement a script management module in your templating system. The typical way to include a script is to use the SCRIPT tag in your HTML page.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      &lt;script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"menu_1.0.17.js\"&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;<\/pre><p>An alternative in PHP would be to create a function called <code>insertScript<\/code>.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      &lt;?php insertScript(\"menu.js\") ?&gt;<\/pre><p>In addition to preventing the same script from being inserted multiple times, this function could handle other issues with scripts, such as dependency checking and adding version numbers to script filenames to support far future Expires headers.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"etags\">\n\tConfigure ETags<\/h3>\n<p>Entity tags (ETags) are a mechanism that web servers and browsers use to determine whether the component in the browser's cache matches the one on the origin server. (An \"entity\" is another word a \"component\": images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) ETags were added to provide a mechanism for validating entities that is more flexible than the last-modified date. An ETag is a string that uniquely identifies a specific version of a component. The only format constraints are that the string be quoted. The origin server specifies the component's ETag using the <code>ETag<\/code>response header.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      HTTP\/1.1 200 OK\n      Last-Modified: Tue, 12 Dec 2006 03:03:59 GMT\n      ETag: \"10c24bc-4ab-457e1c1f\"\n      Content-Length: 12195<\/pre><p>Later, if the browser has to validate a component, it uses the <code>If-None-Match<\/code>header to pass the ETag back to the origin server. If the ETags match, a 304 status code is returned reducing the response by 12195 bytes for this example.<\/p>\n<pre>\n      GET \/i\/yahoo.gif HTTP\/1.1\n      Host: us.yimg.com\n      If-Modified-Since: Tue, 12 Dec 2006 03:03:59 GMT\n      If-None-Match: \"10c24bc-4ab-457e1c1f\"\n      HTTP\/1.1 304 Not Modified<\/pre><p>The problem with ETags is that they typically are constructed using attributes that make them unique to a specific server hosting a site. ETags won't match when a browser gets the original component from one server and later tries to validate that component on a different server, a situation that is all too common on Web sites that use a cluster of servers to handle requests. By default, both Apache and IIS embed data in the ETag that dramatically reduces the odds of the validity test succeeding on web sites with multiple servers.<\/p>\n<p>The ETag format for Apache 1.3 and 2.x is <code>inode-size-timestamp<\/code>. Although a given file may reside in the same directory across multiple servers, and have the same file size, permissions, timestamp, etc., its inode is different from one server to the next.<\/p>\n<p>IIS 5.0 and 6.0 have a similar issue with ETags. The format for ETags on IIS is <code>Filetimestamp:ChangeNumber<\/code>. A <code>ChangeNumber<\/code>is a counter used to track configuration changes to IIS. It's unlikely that the <code>ChangeNumber<\/code>is the same across all IIS servers behind a web site.<\/p>\n<p>The end result is ETags generated by Apache and IIS for the exact same component won't match from one server to another. If the ETags don't match, the user doesn't receive the small, fast 304 response that ETags were designed for; instead, they'll get a normal 200 response along with all the data for the component. If you host your web site on just one server, this isn't a problem. But if you have multiple servers hosting your web site, and you're using Apache or IIS with the default ETag configuration, your users are getting slower pages, your servers have a higher load, you're consuming greater bandwidth, and proxies aren't caching your content efficiently. Even if your components have a far future <code>Expires<\/code>header, a conditional GET request is still made whenever the user hits Reload or Refresh.<\/p>\n<p>If you're not taking advantage of the flexible validation model that ETags provide, it's better to just remove the ETag altogether. The <code>Last-Modified<\/code>header validates based on the component's timestamp. And removing the ETag reduces the size of the HTTP headers in both the response and subsequent requests. This <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/?id=922733\">Microsoft Support article<\/a> describes how to remove ETags. In Apache, this is done by simply adding the following line to your Apache configuration file:<\/p>\n<pre>\n      FileETag none<\/pre><h3 id=\"cacheajax\">\n\tMake Ajax Cacheable<\/h3>\n<p>One of the cited benefits of Ajax is that it provides instantaneous feedback to the user because it requests information asynchronously from the backend web server. However, using Ajax is no guarantee that the user won't be twiddling his thumbs waiting for those asynchronous JavaScript and XML responses to return. In many applications, whether or not the user is kept waiting depends on how Ajax is used. For example, in a web-based email client the user will be kept waiting for the results of an Ajax request to find all the email messages that match their search criteria. It's important to remember that \"asynchronous\" does not imply \"instantaneous\".<\/p>\n<p>To improve performance, it's important to optimize these Ajax responses. The most important way to improve the performance of Ajax is to make the responses cacheable, as discussed in <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#expires\">Add an Expires or a Cache-Control Header<\/a>. Some of the other rules also apply to Ajax:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#gzip\">Gzip Components<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#dns_lookups\">Reduce DNS Lookups<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#minify\">Minify JavaScript<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#redirects\">Avoid Redirects<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#etags\">Configure ETags<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Let's look at an example. A Web 2.0 email client might use Ajax to download the user's address book for autocompletion. If the user hasn't modified her address book since the last time she used the email web app, the previous address book response could be read from cache if that Ajax response was made cacheable with a future Expires or Cache-Control header. The browser must be informed when to use a previously cached address book response versus requesting a new one. This could be done by adding a timestamp to the address book Ajax URL indicating the last time the user modified her address book, for example, <code>&amp;t=1190241612<\/code>. If the address book hasn't been modified since the last download, the timestamp will be the same and the address book will be read from the browser's cache eliminating an extra HTTP roundtrip. If the user has modified her address book, the timestamp ensures the new URL doesn't match the cached response, and the browser will request the updated address book entries.<\/p>\n<p>Even though your Ajax responses are created dynamically, and might only be applicable to a single user, they can still be cached. Doing so will make your Web 2.0 apps faster.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"flush\">\n\tFlush the Buffer Early<\/h3>\n<p>When users request a page, it can take anywhere from 200 to 500ms for the backend server to stitch together the HTML page. During this time, the browser is idle as it waits for the data to arrive. In PHP you have the function <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/flush\">flush()<\/a>. It allows you to send your partially ready HTML response to the browser so that the browser can start fetching components while your backend is busy with the rest of the HTML page. The benefit is mainly seen on busy backends or light frontends.<\/p>\n<p>A good place to consider flushing is right after the HEAD because the HTML for the head is usually easier to produce and it allows you to include any CSS and JavaScript files for the browser to start fetching in parallel while the backend is still processing.<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<pre>\n      ... &lt;!-- css, js --&gt;\n    &lt;\/head&gt;\n    &lt;?php flush(); ?&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n      ... &lt;!-- content --&gt;<\/pre><p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/search.yahoo.com\/\">Yahoo! search<\/a> pioneered research and real user testing to prove the benefits of using this technique.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"ajax_get\">\n\tUse GET for AJAX Requests<\/h3>\n<p>The <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/mail.yahoo.com\/\">Yahoo! Mail<\/a> team found that when using <code>XMLHttpRequest<\/code>, POST is implemented in the browsers as a two-step process: sending the headers first, then sending data. So it's best to use GET, which only takes one TCP packet to send (unless you have a lot of cookies). The maximum URL length in IE is 2K, so if you send more than 2K data you might not be able to use GET.<\/p>\n<p>An interesting side affect is that POST without actually posting any data behaves like GET. Based on the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/Protocols\/rfc2616\/rfc2616-sec9.html\">HTTP specs<\/a>, GET is meant for retrieving information, so it makes sense (semantically) to use GET when you're only requesting data, as opposed to sending data to be stored server-side.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"postload\">\n\tPost-load Components<\/h3>\n<p>You can take a closer look at your page and ask yourself: \"What's absolutely required in order to render the page initially?\". The rest of the content and components can wait.<\/p>\n<p>JavaScript is an ideal candidate for splitting before and after the onload event. For example if you have JavaScript code and libraries that do drag and drop and animations, those can wait, because dragging elements on the page comes after the initial rendering. Other places to look for candidates for post-loading include hidden content (content that appears after a user action) and images below the fold.<\/p>\n<p>Tools to help you out in your effort: <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/imageloader\/\">YUI Image Loader<\/a> allows you to delay images below the fold and the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/get\/\">YUI Get utility<\/a> is an easy way to include JS and CSS on the fly. For an example in the wild take a look at <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/\">Yahoo! Home Page<\/a> with Firebug's Net Panel turned on.<\/p>\n<p>It's good when the performance goals are inline with other web development best practices. In this case, the idea of progressive enhancement tells us that JavaScript, when supported, can improve the user experience but you have to make sure the page works even without JavaScript. So after you've made sure the page works fine, you can enhance it with some post-loaded scripts that give you more bells and whistles such as drag and drop and animations.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"preload\">\n\tPreload Components<\/h3>\n<p>Preload may look like the opposite of post-load, but it actually has a different goal. By preloading components you can take advantage of the time the browser is idle and request components (like images, styles and scripts) you'll need in the future. This way when the user visits the next page, you could have most of the components already in the cache and your page will load much faster for the user.<\/p>\n<p>There are actually several types of preloading:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<em>Unconditional<\/em> preload - as soon as onload fires, you go ahead and fetch some extra components. Check google.com for an example of how a sprite image is requested onload. This sprite image is not needed on the google.com homepage, but it is needed on the consecutive search result page.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Conditional<\/em> preload - based on a user action you make an educated guess where the user is headed next and preload accordingly. On <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/search.yahoo.com\/\">search.yahoo.com<\/a> you can see how some extra components are requested after you start typing in the input box.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<em>Anticipated<\/em> preload - preload in advance before launching a redesign. It often happens after a redesign that you hear: \"The new site is cool, but it's slower than before\". Part of the problem could be that the users were visiting your old site with a full cache, but the new one is always an empty cache experience. You can mitigate this side effect by preloading some components before you even launched the redesign. Your old site can use the time the browser is idle and request images and scripts that will be used by the new site<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3 id=\"min_dom\">\n\tReduce the Number of DOM Elements<\/h3>\n<p>A complex page means more bytes to download and it also means slower DOM access in JavaScript. It makes a difference if you loop through 500 or 5000 DOM elements on the page when you want to add an event handler for example.<\/p>\n<p>A high number of DOM elements can be a symptom that there's something that should be improved with the markup of the page without necessarily removing content. Are you using nested tables for layout purposes? Are you throwing in more <code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code>s only to fix layout issues? Maybe there's a better and more semantically correct way to do your markup.<\/p>\n<p>A great help with layouts are the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/\">YUI CSS utilities<\/a>: grids.css can help you with the overall layout, fonts.css and reset.css can help you strip away the browser's defaults formatting. This is a chance to start fresh and think about your markup, for example use <code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code>s only when it makes sense semantically, and not because it renders a new line.<\/p>\n<p>The number of DOM elements is easy to test, just type in Firebug's console:<br \/><code>document.getElementsByTagName('*').length<\/code><\/p>\n<p>And how many DOM elements are too many? Check other similar pages that have good markup. For example the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/\">Yahoo! Home Page<\/a> is a pretty busy page and still under 700 elements (HTML tags).<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"split\">\n\tSplit Components Across Domains<\/h3>\n<p>Splitting components allows you to maximize parallel downloads. Make sure you're using not more than 2-4 domains because of the DNS lookup penalty. For example, you can host your HTML and dynamic content on <code>www.example.org<\/code>and split static components between <code>static1.example.org<\/code>and <code>static2.example.org<\/code><\/p>\n<p>For more information check \"<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/yuiblog.com\/blog\/2007\/04\/11\/performance-research-part-4\/\">Maximizing Parallel Downloads in the Carpool Lane<\/a>\" by Tenni Theurer and Patty Chi.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"iframes\">\n\tMinimize the Number of iframes<\/h3>\n<p>Iframes allow an HTML document to be inserted in the parent document. It's important to understand how iframes work so they can be used effectively.<\/p>\n<p><code>&lt;iframe&gt;<\/code>pros:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tHelps with slow third-party content like badges and ads<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSecurity sandbox<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tDownload scripts in parallel<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><code>&lt;iframe&gt;<\/code>cons:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tCostly even if blank<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBlocks page onload<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tNon-semantic<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3 id=\"no404\">\n\tNo 404s<\/h3>\n<p>HTTP requests are expensive so making an HTTP request and getting a useless response (i.e. 404 Not Found) is totally unnecessary and will slow down the user experience without any benefit.<\/p>\n<p>Some sites have helpful 404s \"Did you mean X?\", which is great for the user experience but also wastes server resources (like database, etc). Particularly bad is when the link to an external JavaScript is wrong and the result is a 404. First, this download will block parallel downloads. Next the browser may try to parse the 404 response body as if it were JavaScript code, trying to find something usable in it.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"cookie_size\">\n\tReduce Cookie Size<\/h3>\n<p>HTTP cookies are used for a variety of reasons such as authentication and personalization. Information about cookies is exchanged in the HTTP headers between web servers and browsers. It's important to keep the size of cookies as low as possible to minimize the impact on the user's response time.<\/p>\n<p>For more information check <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/yuiblog.com\/blog\/2007\/03\/01\/performance-research-part-3\/\">\"When the Cookie Crumbles\"<\/a> by Tenni Theurer and Patty Chi. The take-home of this research:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tEliminate unnecessary cookies<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tKeep cookie sizes as low as possible to minimize the impact on the user response time<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBe mindful of setting cookies at the appropriate domain level so other sub-domains are not affected<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSet an Expires date appropriately. An earlier Expires date or none removes the cookie sooner, improving the user response time<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3 id=\"cookie_free\">\n\tUse Cookie-free Domains for Components<\/h3>\n<p>When the browser makes a request for a static image and sends cookies together with the request, the server doesn't have any use for those cookies. So they only create network traffic for no good reason. You should make sure static components are requested with cookie-free requests. Create a subdomain and host all your static components there.<\/p>\n<p>If your domain is <code>www.example.org<\/code>, you can host your static components on <code>static.example.org<\/code>. However, if you've already set cookies on the top-level domain <code>example.org<\/code>as opposed to <code>www.example.org<\/code>, then all the requests to <code>static.example.org<\/code>will include those cookies. In this case, you can buy a whole new domain, host your static components there, and keep this domain cookie-free. Yahoo! uses <code>yimg.com<\/code>, YouTube uses <code>ytimg.com<\/code>, Amazon uses <code>images-amazon.com<\/code>and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Another benefit of hosting static components on a cookie-free domain is that some proxies might refuse to cache the components that are requested with cookies. On a related note, if you wonder if you should use example.org or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.org\">www.example.org<\/a> for your home page, consider the cookie impact. Omitting www leaves you no choice but to write cookies to <code>*.example.org<\/code>, so for performance reasons it's best to use the www subdomain and write the cookies to that subdomain.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dom_access\">\n\tMinimize DOM Access<\/h3>\n<p>Accessing DOM elements with JavaScript is slow so in order to have a more responsive page, you should:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tCache references to accessed elements<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tUpdate nodes \"offline\" and then add them to the tree<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tAvoid fixing layout with JavaScript<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>For more information check the YUI theatre's <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/yuiblog.com\/blog\/2007\/12\/20\/video-lecomte\/\">\"High Performance Ajax Applications\"<\/a> by Julien Lecomte.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"events\">\n\tDevelop Smart Event Handlers<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes pages feel less responsive because of too many event handlers attached to different elements of the DOM tree which are then executed too often. That's why using <em>event delegation<\/em> is a good approach. If you have 10 buttons inside a <code>div<\/code>, attach only one event handler to the div wrapper, instead of one handler for each button. Events bubble up so you'll be able to catch the event and figure out which button it originated from.<\/p>\n<p>You also don't need to wait for the onload event in order to start doing something with the DOM tree. Often all you need is the element you want to access to be available in the tree. You don't have to wait for all images to be downloaded. <code>DOMContentLoaded<\/code>is the event you might consider using instead of onload, but until it's available in all browsers, you can use the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/event\/\">YUI Event<\/a> utility, which has an <code><a href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/event\/#onavailable\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/yui\/event\/#onavailable\">onAvailable<\/a><\/code>method.<\/p>\n<p>For more information check the YUI theatre's <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/yuiblog.com\/blog\/2007\/12\/20\/video-lecomte\/\">\"High Performance Ajax Applications\"<\/a> by Julien Lecomte.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"csslink\">\n\tChoose &lt;link&gt; over @import<\/h3>\n<p>One of the previous best practices states that CSS should be at the top in order to allow for progressive rendering.<\/p>\n<p>In IE <code>@import<\/code>behaves the same as using <code>&lt;link&gt;<\/code>at the bottom of the page, so it's best not to use it.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"no_filters\">\n\tAvoid Filters<\/h3>\n<p>The IE-proprietary <code>AlphaImageLoader<\/code>filter aims to fix a problem with semi-transparent true color PNGs in IE versions &lt; 7. The problem with this filter is that it blocks rendering and freezes the browser while the image is being downloaded. It also increases memory consumption and is applied per element, not per image, so the problem is multiplied.<\/p>\n<p>The best approach is to avoid <code>AlphaImageLoader<\/code>completely and use gracefully degrading PNG8 instead, which are fine in IE. If you absolutely need <code>AlphaImageLoader<\/code>, use the underscore hack <code>_filter<\/code>as to not penalize your IE7+ users.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"opt_images\">\n\tOptimize Images<\/h3>\n<p>After a designer is done with creating the images for your web page, there are still some things you can try before you FTP those images to your web server.<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tYou can check the GIFs and see if they are using a palette size corresponding to the number of colors in the image. Using <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.imagemagick.org\/\">imagemagick<\/a> it's easy to check using<br \/><code>identify -verbose image.gif<\/code><br \/>\n\t\tWhen you see an image useing 4 colors and a 256 color \"slots\" in the palette, there is room for improvement.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tTry converting GIFs to PNGs and see if there is a saving. More often than not, there is. Developers often hesitate to use PNGs due to the limited support in browsers, but this is now a thing of the past. The only real problem is alpha-transparency in true color PNGs, but then again, GIFs are not true color and don't support variable transparency either. So anything a GIF can do, a palette PNG (PNG8) can do too (except for animations). This simple imagemagick command results in totally safe-to-use PNGs:<br \/><code>convert image.gif image.png<\/code>\n<div style=\"display:none; visibility:hidden;\" id=\"osbe\"><\/div>\n<p>\t\t\"All we are saying is: Give PiNG a Chance!\"<\/p><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tRun <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/pmt.sourceforge.net\/pngcrush\/\">pngcrush<\/a> (or any other PNG optimizer tool) on all your PNGs. Example:<br \/><code>pngcrush image.png -rem alla -reduce -brute result.png<\/code><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tRun jpegtran on all your JPEGs. This tool does lossless JPEG operations such as rotation and can also be used to optimize and remove comments and other useless information (such as EXIF information) from your images.<br \/><code>jpegtran -copy none -optimize -perfect src.jpg dest.jpg<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul><h3 id=\"opt_sprites\">\n\tOptimize CSS Sprites<\/h3>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tArranging the images in the sprite horizontally as opposed to vertically usually results in a smaller file size.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCombining similar colors in a sprite helps you keep the color count low, ideally under 256 colors so to fit in a PNG8.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\"Be mobile-friendly\" and don't leave big gaps between the images in a sprite. This doesn't affect the file size as much but requires less memory for the user agent to decompress the image into a pixel map. 100x100 image is 10 thousand pixels, where 1000x1000 is 1 million pixels<\/li>\n<\/ul><h3 id=\"no_scale\">\n\tDon't Scale Images in HTML<\/h3>\n<p>tag: images<\/p>\n<p>Don't use a bigger image than you need just because you can set the width and height in HTML. If you need<br \/><code>&lt;img width=\"100\" height=\"100\" src=\"mycat.jpg\" alt=\"My Cat\" \/&gt;<\/code><br \/>\n\tthen your image (mycat.jpg) should be 100x100px rather than a scaled down 500x500px image.<\/p>\n<p><a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#page-nav\">top<\/a><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"favicon\">\n\tMake favicon.ico Small and Cacheable<\/h3>\n<p>The favicon.ico is an image that stays in the root of your server. It's a necessary evil because even if you don't care about it the browser will still request it, so it's better not to respond with a <code>404 Not Found<\/code>. Also since it's on the same server, cookies are sent every time it's requested. This image also interferes with the download sequence, for example in IE when you request extra components in the onload, the favicon will be downloaded before these extra components.<\/p>\n<p>So to mitigate the drawbacks of having a favicon.ico make sure:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tIt's small, preferably under 1K.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSet Expires header with what you feel comfortable (since you cannot rename it if you decide to change it).

If you are tracking state in the request, either by cookies or in another way, you have the possibility of destroying data. Even though the image request does not return an image, all of the headers are read and accepted by the browser, including all cookies. While the rest of the response is thrown away, the damage may already be done.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>The root cause of this behavior is the way that URI resolution is performed in browsers. This behavior is defined in RFC 3986 - Uniform Resource Identifiers. When an empty string is encountered as a URI, it is considered a relative URI and is resolved according to the algorithm defined in section 5.2. This specific example, an empty string, is listed in section 5.4. Firefox, Safari, and Chrome are all resolving an empty string correctly per the specification, while Internet Explorer is resolving it incorrectly, apparently in line with an earlier version of the specification, RFC 2396 - Uniform Resource Identifiers (this was obsoleted by RFC 3986). So technically, the browsers are doing what they are supposed to do to resolve relative URIs. The problem is that in this context, the empty string is clearly unintentional.<\/p>\n<p>HTML5 adds to the description of the tag's src attribute to instruct browsers not to make an additional request in section 4.8.2:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid URL referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor scripted. If the base URI of the element is the same as the document's address, then the src attribute's value must not be the empty string.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully, browsers will not have this problem in the future. Unfortunately, there is no such clause for &lt;script src=\"\"&gt; and &lt;link href=\"\"&gt;. Maybe there is still time to make that adjustment to ensure browsers don't accidentally implement this behavior.<\/p>\n<p>This rule was inspired by Yahoo!'s JavaScript guru Nicolas C. Zakas.

            "articleBody": "<p>By Steve W. Martin, who teaches sales strategy at the USC Marshall School of Business<\/p>\n<p>In the late sixth century, Pope Gregory described the seven deadly sins from the least serious to the most, as superbia, invidia, ira, avaritia, tristia, gula, and luxuria. Translated from Latin, they are pride, envy, anger, avarice, sadness, gluttony, and lust. What do you think are the seven deadly sins of salespeople? Here's my list, in order of least to most severe.<\/p>\n<p>Chattering. Salespeople talk too much on sales calls for a variety of reasons. Some are nervous chatterers who just can't keep their mouths shut. Others think they know more than the customer so they lecture the customer to death. Many salespeople feel compelled to recite their canned pitch regardless of the customer's actual interest. You have conducted a perfect sales call when the customer has been persuaded to buy even though you listened far more than you spoke.<\/p>\n<p>Gourmandizing. Millionaire railroad tycoon Diamond Jim Brady was a legendary gourmand who lived at the turn of the twentieth century. For breakfast he ate eggs, pancakes, pork chops, cornbread, fried potatoes, hominy, muffins, and beefsteak and drank a gallon of orange juice. Lunch consisted of two lobsters, deviled crabs, clams, oysters, beef, and several pies. A platter of seafood and carafes of lemon soda constituted his 4:30 snack. The evening meal began with three dozen oysters, six crabs, and turtle soup. The main course was two whole ducks, six or seven lobsters, a sirloin steak, and servings of vegetables. Dessert included a platter of pastries and often a two-pound box of candy. Does your sales organization include a \"Diamond Jim Brady\" who devours company resources to the point of gluttony?<\/p>\n<p>Inactivity. Salespeople must be short-term thinkers and long-term planners. An inactive salesperson neglects the future and does not spend time on activities that build his future pipeline. Inactivity is not to be confused with laziness. Many hardworking salespeople are completely focused on the here and now. Unfortunately, they forget about next quarter and next year. Other salespeople never really think about what will happen if their big deal collapses. They have been lulled into a state of inactivity and could be jolted into reality at any moment.<\/p>\n<p>Obliviousness. Many salespeople don't take the time to understand how customers fit within their own organization. I am continually amazed at the lackadaisical attitude many salespeople have about understanding the organizational structure of the companies they call on. When they are asked what a person's title is, they will answer, \"manager,\" or something equally nebulous, when they should answer, \"manager of application security who reports to the director of application development, who, in turn, reports to the CIO.\"<\/p>\n<p>Shallowness. Salespeople who don't know their product well enough to build customer credibility cannot be expected to drive account strategy. How can you determine your next course of action if you don't understand the customer's technical objections and how best to emphasize the product's strengths? Worse, in this situation you are completely at the mercy of someone else because another member of your company has to explain how your product works.<\/p>\n<p>Presumptuousness. Assuming information you really don't know is one of the worst sins for a salesperson. Salespeople who are not certain but make their best guess about who the ultimate and final decision maker is within an account are more than halfway to losing the deal.<\/p>\n<p>Ignorance. Ignorance is the deadliest sin. If you do not have a contact within an account who is telling you what is happening in closed-door meetings, defending you when you are not around, and disseminating propaganda on your behalf, you will most certainly lose.<\/p>\n<p>Your success is your responsibility. The salesperson who avoids committing these seven deadly sins is well on his or her way to becoming a truly great salesperson.<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>Reusable Queries communicates with the database and they are stored with the database files, they can be called by the user to perform the related task. It reduces the time to write the same queries again &amp; again.<\/p>\n<p>Databases being the backbone of any application required to be handled in such a fashion, where queries to access records(from tables) are done quickly, easily and without writing them over again<\/p>\n<p>MySQL queries can be reused by following ways<\/p>\n<p>* Store Procedure<br \/>\n\t* View<br \/>\n\t* User define function<br \/>\n\t* Trigger<br \/>\n\t* Cache Query<br \/>\n\t* Built-in MySQL functions<\/p>\n<p>I want to discuss about features and limitations of Query Cache:<\/p>\n<p>Transparent Caching \u2013 Caching is fully transparent to the application, and what is very important it does not change semantics of the queries \u2013 you always get actual query results. Really there are some chevats \u2013 if you\u2019re not using query_cache_wlock_invalidate=ON locking table for write would not invalidate query cache so you can get results even if table is locked and is being prepared to be updated. So if you\u2019re using query cache in default configuration you can\u2019t assume locking table for write will mean no one will be able to read it \u2013 results still can come from query cache unless you enable query_cache_wlock_invalidate=ON.<\/p>\n<p>Caching full queries only \u2013 Meaning it does not work for subselects, inline views, parts of the UNION. This is also common missunderstanding.<\/p>\n<p>Works on packet level \u2013 This is one of the reason for previous item. Query cache catches network packets as they sent from client to the server, which means it can serve responses very fast doing no extra conversion or processing.<\/p>\n<p>Works before parsing \u2013 One more reason for high performance is Query Cache performs query lookup in the cache before query parsing, so if result is served from query cache, query parsing step is saved.<\/p>\n<p>Queries must be absolutely the same As no parsing is done before lookup queries are not normalized (would require parsing) before cache lookup, so they have to match byte by byte for cache hit to happen. This means if you would place dynamic comments in the query, have extra space or use different case \u2013 these would be different queries for query cache.<\/p>\n<p>Only SELECT queries are cached SHOW commands or stored procedure calls are not, even if stored procedure would simply preform select to retrieve data from table.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid comment (and space) in the start of the query \u2013 Query Cache does simple optimization to check if query can be cached. As I mentioned only SELECT queries are cached \u2013 so it looks at first letter of the query and if it is \u201cS\u201d it proceeds with query lookup in cache if not \u2013 skips it.<\/p>\n<p>Does not support prepared statements and cursors Query Cache works with query text and want full result set at once. In prepared statements there is query with placeholders and additional parameter values which would need extra care \u2013 it is not implemented. Cursors get data in chunks so it is even harder to implement.<\/p>\n<p>Might not work with transactions \u2013 Different transactions may see different states of the database, depending on the updates they have performed and even depending on snapshot they are working on. If you\u2019re using statements outside of transaction you have best chance for them to be cached.<\/p>\n<p>Query must be deterministic \u2013 Query might provide same result no matter how many times it is run, if data remains the same. So if query works with current data, uses non-deterministic functions such as UUID(), RAND(), CONNECTION_ID() etc it will not be cached.<\/p>\n<p>Table level granularity in invalidation \u2013 If table gets modification all queries derived from this table are invalidated at once. Most of them quite likely would not have change their result set but MySQL has no way to identify which one of them would so it gets rid of all of them. This is one of the main features which limits query cache effectiveness \u2013 if you have high write application such as forums, query cache efficiency might be pretty low due to this. There is also way to set minimal TTL or anything like it which is allowed by other caching systems. Also note \u2013 all queries are removed from cache on table modifications \u2013 if there are a lot of queries being cached this might reduce update speed a bit.<\/p>\n<p>Fragmentation over time \u2013 Over time Query Cache might get fragmented, which reduces performance. This can be seen as large value of Qcache_free_blocks relatively to Qcache_free_memory. FLUSH QUERY CACHE command can be used for query cache defragmentation but it may block query cache for rather long time for large query caches, which might be unsuitable for online applications.<\/p>\n<p>Limited amount of usable memory \u2013 Queries are constantly being invalidated from query cache by table updates, this means number of queries in cache and memory used can\u2019t grow forever even if your have very large amount of different queries being run. Of course in some cases you have tables which are never modified which would flood query cahe but it unusual. So you might want to set query cache to certain value and watch Qcache_free_memory and Qcache_lowmem_prunes \u2013 If you\u2019re not getting much of lowmem_prunes and free_memory stays high you can reduce query_cache appropriately. Otherwise you might wish to increase it and see if efficiency increases.<\/p>\n<p>Demand operating mode If you just enable qury cache it will operate in \u201cCache everything\u201d mode. In certain caches you might want to cache only some of the queries \u2013 in this case you can set query_cache_type to \u201cDEMAND\u201d and use only SQL_CACHE hint for queries which you want to have cached \u2013 such as SELECT SQL_CACHE col from foo where id=5. If you run in default mode you can also use SQL_NO_CACHE to block caching for certain queries, which you know do not need to be cached.<\/p>\n<p>Counting query cache efficiency There are few ways you can look at query_cache efficiency. First looking at number of your selects \u2013 Com_select and see how many of them are cached. Query Cache efficiency would be Qcache_hits\/(Com_select+Qcache_hits). As you can see we have to add Qcache_hits to Com_select to get total number of queries as if query cache hit happens Com_select is not incremented. But if you have just 20% Cache hit rate does it mean it is not worth it ? Not really it depends on which queries are cached, as well as overhead query cache provides. One portion of query cache overhead is of course inserts so you can see how much of inserted queries are used: Qcache_hits\/Qcache_inserts Other portion of overhead comes from modification statements which you can calculate by (Com_insert+Com_delete+Com_update+Com_replace)\/Qcache_hits<br \/>\n\t. These are some numbers you can play with but it is hard to tell what is good or bad as a lot depends on statement complexity as well as how much work is saved by query cache.<\/p>\n<p>So when it is good idea to use query cache ?<\/p>\n<p>Third party application \u2013 You can\u2019t change how it works with MySQL to add caching but you can enable query cache so it works faster.<\/p>\n<p>Low load applications \u2013 If you\u2019re building application which is not designed for extreme load, like many personal application query cache might be all you need. Especially if it is mostly read only scenario.<\/p>\n<p>Why Look for alternatives ?<\/p>\n<p>There are few reasons why Query Cache might be not cache for your application:<\/p>\n<p>It caches queries Application objects might need several queries to compose so it is efficient to cache whole objects rather than individual queries.<\/p>\n<p>No control on invalidation Table granularity is often too bad. With other caches you may implement version based or timeout based invalidation which can offer much better hit ratio for certain application.<\/p>\n<p>It is not that fast Query Cache is fast compared to running the queries but it is still not as fast as specially designed systems such as memcached or local shared memory.<\/p>\n<p>It can\u2019t retrieve multiple objects at the same time You have to query cache object by object which adds latency, there is no way you can request all objects you need to be retrieved at the same time (again memcached has it)<\/p>\n<p>It is not distributed If you have 10 slaves and use query cache on all of them cache content will likely be the same, so you have multiple copies of the same data in cache effectively wasting memory. Distirbuted caching systems can effectively use memory on multiple systems so there is no duplication.<\/p>\n<p>1\/. Views:<br \/>\n\t--------------<br \/>\n\tA view is really nothing more than a virtual table. That is, it looks like a table and behaves like one, but it only exists in a compiled form. In effect, the table is in substantiated when the view is referenced. You can refer to this virtual table (the view) in any query where you could refer to a 'real' table. There are some restrictions on this, especially with regards to updating via the view.<\/p>\n<p>A view cannot take parameters. However, it can be used as a security mechanism without giving permission to the underlying tables.<\/p>\n<p>A view is a very handy mechanism for insulating the complexity of the database. A view can be constructed which hides the details of normalization.<\/p>\n<p>2\/. Stored procedure :<br \/>\n\t-------------------------<br \/>\n\tA stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications accessing a relational database system. Stored procedures are actually stored in the database data dictionary.<\/p>\n<p>Typical uses for stored procedures include data validation (integrated into the database) or access control mechanisms. Furthermore, stored procedures are used to consolidate and centralize logic that was originally implemented in applications. Extensive or complex processing that requires the execution of several SQL statements is moved into stored procedures, and all applications call the procedures. One can use nested stored procedures, by executing one stored procedure from within another.<\/p>\n<p>Stored procedures are similar to user-defined functions (UDFs). The major difference is that UDFs can be used like any other expression within SQL statements, whereas stored procedures must be invoked using the CALL statement.<\/p>\n<p>3\/. User Define function:<br \/>\n\t------------------------------<br \/>\n\tA user-defined function provides a mechanism for extending the functionality of the database server by adding a function that can be evaluated in SQL statements. The SQL standard distinguishes between scalar and table functions. A scalar function returns only a single value (or NULL), whereas a table function returns a (relational) table comprising zero or more rows, each row with one or more columns.<\/p>\n<p>4\/. MySql Built in functions :<br \/>\n\t----------------------------------<br \/>\n\tA built-in function is an expression in which an SQL keyword or special operator executes some operation. Built-in functions use keywords or special built-in operators. Example : Aggregates functions.<\/p>\n<p>3.Views.<\/p>\n<p>A view is quite easy to define, but a lot more difficult to create, use and manage. It\u2019s not anymore than a named SELECT statement, or a virtual table. You can select data, alter data, remove data and all other things you can do with a table (with some limitations). But there is a difference between a view and a table. The data accessible through a view is not stored in the database as its own object. It\u2019s stored in the underlying tables that make up the view. The only thing that is stored in the database is the SELECT statement that forms the virtual<\/p>\n<p>View can be very useful as .<\/p>\n<p>* Restrict data access and\/or simplify data access<br \/>\n\tA view can be used to limit the user to only use a few columns in a table. For example if we do not want a user to be able to access all columns because of security. But it could also be because not all columns are interesting for the user. It is also possible to limit access to rows, using a WHERE clause. If we use USER_ID(), we can even find out who is using the view, and return only data that is relevant for this user. Furthermore, a view can join several tables, in several databases on several servers, but all the user use is the view\u2019s name. Simple, but powerful!<br \/>\n\t* Simplify data manipulation<br \/>\n\tWe can also use a view to manipulate data. Often with a relational database design, this means that many tables must be joined together. Using a view can simplify this, and the users do not need to know all tables involved.<br \/>\n\t* Import and export data<br \/>\n\tA view can also be used to export and\/or import data to\/from another application. Both the bcp utility and BULK INSERT works with a view.<br \/>\n\t* Merge data<br \/>\n\tA so called Partition View can be used to merge data from multiple tables in multiple databases, so it appears as one table only, but it is in fact several tables. This can be accomplished by using the UNION operator. For example if we had customers in Europe and United States, we could have one server for Europe, and one for United States, with tables that are identical, and then merge all data in a partitioned view. More on this later.<\/p>\n<p>4.Triggers : A special kind of stored procedure that is invoked automatically when an attempt is made to modify the data in the table it protects. Enforces Data Integrity.<\/p>\n<p>5.Query Cache : The query cache is extremely useful when your application executes a particular query again and again and tables don't change very often. MySQL caches the result, thereby avoiding the overhead of running through data over and over and thereby increase the execution time. In case your tables change very often or if your queries are textually different every time, the query cache may<br \/>\n\tresult in a slowdown instead of a performance improvement.<\/p>\n<p>How to enable Query Cache<\/p>\n<p>Query caching can be enabled by setting the server variables query_cache_type, query_cache_size, and query_cache_limit. If any of these three variables is set to 0, query caching will be disabled.<\/p>\n<p>1. query_cache_type This variable has three status which can be set as follow:<br \/>\n\t1. query_cache_type = 0 \/\/ disabled<br \/>\n\t2. query_cache_type = 1 \/\/ enabled (except SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE ... queries)<br \/>\n\t3. query_cache_type = 2 \/\/ enabled but works on demand (cache only SELECT SQL_CACHE ... queries)<br \/>\n\t2. query_cache_size The memory allocated to store results. In case of 0, the query cache is disabled. query_cache_size needs a minimum size of about 40KB to allocate its structures.<br \/>\n\t3. query_cache_limit The results bigger than this are not cached. (Default 1M).<\/p>\n<p>Stored Procedure :<\/p>\n<p>A stored procedure is a procedure (like a subprogram in a regular computing language) that is stored (in the database).<\/p>\n<p>A stored procedure has a name, a parameter list, and an SQL statement, which can contain many more SQL statements. There is new syntax for local variables, error handling, loop control, and IF conditions. Here is an example of a statement that creates a stored procedure.<\/p>\n<p>CREATE PROCEDURE procedure1 \/* name *\/<br \/>\n\t(IN parameter1 INTEGER) \/* parameters *\/<br \/>\n\tBEGIN \/* start of block *\/<br \/>\n\tDECLARE variable1 CHAR(10); \/* variables *\/<br \/>\n\tIF parameter1 = 17 THEN \/* start of IF *\/<br \/>\n\tSET variable1 = 'birds'; \/* assignment *\/<br \/>\n\tELSE<br \/>\n\tSET variable1 = 'beasts'; \/* assignment *\/<br \/>\n\tEND IF; \/* end of IF *\/<br \/>\n\tINSERT INTO table1 VALUES (variable1); \/* statement *\/<br \/>\n\tEND \/* end of block *\/<\/p>\n<p>Stored procedure reduced the traffic between application and database server because instead of sending multiple uncompiled long SQL commands statement, application only has to send the stored procedure name and get the result back.Once created, stored procedure is compiled and stored in the database catalog. It runs faster than uncompilable SQL commands which are sent from application<\/p>\n<p>Triggers -<br \/>\n\tA MySQL trigger is a piece of code that fires whenever something happens to a table, and that something can be one of three table events:<\/p>\n<p>* delete - the trigger fires if something is deleted from the table<br \/>\n\t* insert - the trigger fires if something is inserted into the table<br \/>\n\t* update - the trigger fires if the table is updated<br \/>\n\t* before the event occurs<br \/>\n\t* after the event occurs<\/p>\n<p>E.g Update employee_perfomance table when a new task is inserted in task table. Here, the trigger is \u201cupdate\u201d and the event is \u201cinserting a new row\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Query Cache -<br \/>\n\tThe query cache stores the text of a SELECT statement together with the corresponding result set. If an identical statement is received later, the server retrieves the results from the query cache rather than parsing and executing the statement again. The query cache is shared among sessions, so a result set generated by one client can be sent in response to the same query issued by another client. Most MySQL servers have query caching enabled by default. It's one of the most effective methods of improving performance.<\/p>\n<p>It's a beautiful thing, but query caching isn't without limitations. Take the following statement:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT emp_id,<br \/>\n\tbonus_id<br \/>\n\tFROM bonuses<br \/>\n\tWHERE YEAR(award_date) = Year(CURDATE());<\/p>\n<p>The problem here is that queries, which contain certain non-deterministic functions - that is those which MySQL cannot calculate in advance - like NOW() and RAND() are not cached.<\/p>\n<p>Reusable Queries are the queries which are written to communicate with the database and are stored with the database files, thus can be called by the user in order to perform the related task.<\/p>\n<p>Followiing techniques comes in \u201cReusable Mysql\u201d category.<\/p>\n<p>1.<\/p>\n<p>Store Procedure :A stored procedure, which calls itself, is recursive stored procedure.Stored procedure reduced the traffic between application and database server because instead of sending multiple uncompiled long SQL commands statement, application only has to send the stored procedure name and get the result back.Once created, stored procedure is compiled and stored in the database catalog. It runs faster than uncompilable SQL commands which are sent from application.<br \/>\n\t2.<\/p>\n<p>Cursor: A \u2018cursor\u2019 in MySQL is essentially just the result set that\u2019s returned from a query. Using a cursor allows you to iterate, or step through, the results of a query and perform certain operations on each row that\u2019s returned.<br \/>\n\t3.<\/p>\n<p>Trigger: A Trigger is a block of code,fired whenever data in the underlying table is affected by any of the Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements -INSERT,UPDATE,OR DELETE.Creating reusable event triggers enables us to model events more easily and quickly. We make the necessary settings once and then assign the trigger to more than one event in our process. The event trigger represents the web service endpoint of the process at runtime.<br \/>\n\t4.<\/p>\n<p>Views : views are essentially a way to package up SELECT statements into re-usable virtual tables whereby the data can be retrieved simply by referencing the view, rather than having to repeat the associated SELECT statement.<br \/>\n\t5.<\/p>\n<p>Writing reusable select statements.<br \/>\n\t6.<\/p>\n<p>Query Cache :The MySQL Query Cache can have a huge positive impact on your database performance if we have a database which processes lots of reusable SELECT statements. Reusable referring to statements which repeated by multiple users, therefore if user A executes a SELECT, and then user B issues the exact same statement, the MySQL Query Cache will just return the results of the first execution without needing to re-execute the SQL.<br \/>\n\t7.<\/p>\n<p>User defined functions: Basically an User Defined Function (UDF) is a piece code that extends the functionality of a MySQL server by adding a new function that behaves just like a native (built-in) MySQL function like abs() or concat().UDFs are useful when we need to extend the functionality of our MySQL server.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mysqlperformanceblog.com\/2006\/07\/27\/mysql-query-cache\/'\">http:\/\/www.mysqlperformanceblog.com\/2006\/07\/27\/mysql-query-cache\/'<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.databasejournal.com\/features\/mysql\/article.php\/3918761\/article.htm\">http:\/\/www.databasejournal.com\/features\/mysql\/article.php\/3918761\/articl...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In order to improve overall application performance, it\u2019s very important to construct SQL queries in the most efficient way. There can be many different ways to write a SQL query. Here are few tips that can help you in writing efficient and reusable SQL queries :<\/p>\n<p>1. Order of the tables in Joins.<\/p>\n<p>2. Name the Columns in a Query.<\/p>\n<p>3. Use table alias.<\/p>\n<p>4. Never compare NULL to anything else.<\/p>\n<p>5. Use Bind Variables.<\/p>\n<p>6. SQL Writing Convention.<\/p>\n<p>7. Use EXISTS instead of DISTINCT.<\/p>\n<p>8. Use of expressions and indexes.<\/p>\n<p>9. Use of NOT operator on indexed columns.<\/p>\n<p>10. Function or Calculation on indexed columns.<\/p>\n<p>11. Avoid Transformed Columns in the WHERE Clause.<\/p>\n<p>12. Combine Multiples Scans with CASE Statements.<\/p>\n<p>Purpose of Views<\/p>\n<p>(1) Join Tables<\/p>\n<p>(2)Customize Data<\/p>\n<p>(3)Restricting Columns and Rows<\/p>\n<p>Restrictions of View<\/p>\n<p>(1) We cannot create a trigger or an index on a view.<\/p>\n<p>(2) A view contain up to 250 columns.<\/p>\n<p>(3) We cannot use the UNION operators within a CREATE VIEW statement. But we can use the UNION operator to merge two views into a single result set.<\/p>\n<p>(4) Modification statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are allowed on multi table views if the statement affects only one base table at a time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/itnewscast.com\/database\/writing-reusable-queries-mysql\">http:\/\/itnewscast.com\/database\/writing-reusable-queries-mysql<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/naturebios.com\/natureboard\/tips-for-writing-efficient-sql-queries-t-2881.html\">http:\/\/naturebios.com\/natureboard\/tips-for-writing-efficient-sql-queries...<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.developertutorials.com\/tutorials\/mysql-tutorials\/using-mysql-functions-for-more-efficient-web-applications-850\/\">http:\/\/www.developertutorials.com\/tutorials\/mysql-tutorials\/using-mysql-...<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.databasejournal.com\/features\/mysql\/article.php\/3918761\/article.htm\">http:\/\/www.databasejournal.com\/features\/mysql\/article.php\/3918761\/articl...<\/a><\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>From its inception, speed has been a strong point of the MySQL database server. In fact, its developers have long been cautious to add new features at the expense of performance even when faced by withering pressure from detractors. Yet over time MySQL's features caught up with its blazing speed, and today its used to power some of the highest traffic websites in the world, Yahoo! Finance, Craiglist, and TicketMaster among them. Accordingly, for most applications chances are MySQL is going to perform to your expectations.<\/p>\n<p>However, with Web traffic exploding, and the complexity of applications increasing all the time, you should strive to optimize your database from its very inception, and continue to review and refine its structure and query activity over its lifetime. You can do so by following a process I refer to as NICM, or preferably, \"Neglecting to Index Causes Misery\" (those of you new to database optimization will soon get the joke). This process consists of five steps, including Normalize, Index, Cache, and Monitor. In this inaugural installment of my new MySQL series for Developer.com, I'll introduce these five steps, highlighting not only how they will ensure your database is running at full tilt, but also how they will actually help you to more effectively manage your data.<br \/>\n\tNormalize<\/p>\n<p>The relational database is aptly named because it promotes the strategy of managing data through well-defined relations. By creating and enforcing relations, its possible to greatly reduce the possibility inconsistencies could creep into the data. This strategy is known as database normalization, of which there are several well-defined states, also known as forms.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate both the concept and importance of normalization, consider a scenario in which you're tasked with creating a corporate human resources application capable of managing employee information. This application would allow the HR manager to easily insert, update, view and delete employee data. Each employee record would contain the usual information, including name, phone number, position, salary, and supervisor.<\/p>\n<p>Note that in the opening sentence I stated that relational databases promote the strategy of managing data through well-defined relations\u2014you're certainly not constrained to do so. Therefore there's nothing to prevent you from creating a single table that looks like this:<\/p>\n<p>CREATE TABLE employees (<\/p>\n<p>name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>telephone CHAR(10) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>position VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>salary DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>supervisor VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL<\/p>\n<p>)<\/p>\n<p>Yet several problems with this approach should be evident. Because the data types used to define these columns are all indicative of an input method requiring the manager to manually enter each value. For example, the manager might type the following values into the web form when adding a new employee:<\/p>\n<p>\"Jason Gilmore\", \"614-999-9999\", \"Software Developer\", \"50000.00\", \"John Thompson\"<\/p>\n<p>But what if over time the manager begins to enter the \"Software Developer\" title as \"Sft. Dev.\", and occasionally forgets the periods, using just \"Sft Dev\"? These inconsistencies eliminate the possibility of using simple SELECT queries to retrieve the roster of software developers. The simple answer to the problem is to normalize the position data, creating a new table intended to contain the master list of all possible positions:<\/p>\n<p>CREATE TABLE positions (<\/p>\n<p>id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,<\/p>\n<p>name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL<\/p>\n<p>)<\/p>\n<p>Then you revise the employees table so that it refers to a position's primary key rather than the name (in the revised table, the _fk postfix is simply a naming convention to remind the database administrator that this column points to a foreign table key):<\/p>\n<p>CREATE TABLE employees (<\/p>\n<p>name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>telephone CHAR(10) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>position_fk TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>salary DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>supervisor VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL<\/p>\n<p>)<\/p>\n<p>Now you can retrieve the positions from the positions table and use them to populate a drop-down list. This forces the manager to choose from a constrained set rather than haphazardly type in the titles.<\/p>\n<p>A similar normalization improvement can be made to the supervisor column, although this is a case where an additional table isn't necessary. All you need to do is modify the employees table anew so it looks like this:<\/p>\n<p>CREATE TABLE employees (<\/p>\n<p>id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,<\/p>\n<p>name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>telephone CHAR(10) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>position_fk TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>salary DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>supervisor_pk SMALLINT UNSIGNED<\/p>\n<p>)<\/p>\n<p>Can you figure out the origin of the data used to populate the supervisor_pk column? That's right, the very same employees table!<\/p>\n<p>This is just a taste of how database normalization can greatly reduce the data inconsistencies that can arise over time. For a great summary of the concept and the various forms I alluded to earlier in the section, see the Wikipedia article on this topic.<\/p>\n<p>I also suggest downloading MySQL's free MySQL Query Browser application, which can help you to visualize the data and its various relationships in a manner much more efficient than if you were using the command-line client.<br \/>\n\tIndex<\/p>\n<p>Once the tables have been properly designed and normalized, you should next take some time to think about what data will most commonly be queried, and create special data structures known as indexes which will dramatically improve the performance of these query operations. Indexes are important because they organize the indexed data in a way that allows MySQL to retrieve the desired record in the fastest possible fashion. In the previous section you already encountered an index, although it isn't apparent: the primary key. But the primary key will only speed query operations when you're searching for a record by using that primary key as the identifier, for example:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT name, telephone FROM employees WHERE id='3'<\/p>\n<p>What if you wanted to search for one or several records based on the employee name? The query might look like this:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT id FROM employees WHERE name='John Smith'<\/p>\n<p>To speed these sorts of queries, you'll need to add an index to the name column. The revised employees table looks like this:<\/p>\n<p>CREATE TABLE employees (<\/p>\n<p>id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,<\/p>\n<p>name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>INDEX (name),<\/p>\n<p>telephone CHAR(10) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>position_fk TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>salary DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>supervisor_pk SMALLINT UNSIGNED<\/p>\n<p>)<\/p>\n<p>You can also create multiple-column indexes that would greatly improve the performance of queries such as this:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT id FROM employees WHERE firstname = 'John' and lastname = 'Smith'<\/p>\n<p>The revised employees table would look like this (I've also broken the name into two separate columns as indicated by the query):<\/p>\n<p>CREATE TABLE employees (<\/p>\n<p>id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,<\/p>\n<p>firstname VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>lastname VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>INDEX name (firstname, lastname),<\/p>\n<p>telephone CHAR(10) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>position_fk TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>salary DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,<\/p>\n<p>supervisor_pk SMALLINT UNSIGNED<\/p>\n<p>)<\/p>\n<p>This new index would actually improve quite a few queries, including the following:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT telephone, position FROM employees WHERE firstname = 'John'<\/p>\n<p>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE firstname = 'John' and lastname = 'Smith'<\/p>\n<p>Table indexing can be a rather confusing topic, although the time invested in learning its nuances will be well worth it. I suggest reading the following MySQL manual pages for more information:<\/p>\n<p>* 7.4.3. Column Indexes<br \/>\n\t* 7.4.4. Multiple-Column Indexes<br \/>\n\t* 7.4.5. How MySQL Uses Indexes<\/p>\n<p>Cache<\/p>\n<p>MySQL is often used to dynamically generate web pages based on similar queries and rarely changing data. For instance, consider the home page of Developer.com, which likely depends on a single query used to repeatedly retrieve the latest ten or so articles. New articles are typically published early to mid-morning, meaning the relevant data found on this page really only chances perhaps once or twice a day. Why not cache the data returned by these queries, thereby bypassing the need to repeatedly retrieve it from the database? Introduced in version 4, enabling MySQL's query caching mechanism can result in a huge performance gain over neglecting to do so.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about how your MySQL installation's query caching mechanism is configured, run the following command:<\/p>\n<p>mysql&gt;SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%query_cache%'<\/p>\n<p>For more information about MySQL's caching feature, see 5.13. The MySQL Query Cache.<br \/>\n\tMonitor<\/p>\n<p>The reasoning behind this step should be obvious: how are you going to know what should be optimized if you're not actively monitoring how MySQL is operating? Thankfully, MySQL's developers have been particularly proactive in providing developers with the tools for keeping abreast of database performance.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, you should familiarize yourself with MySQL's EXPLAIN query, which will provide detailed information regarding how MySQL goes about executing a SELECT query. You'll learn valuable tips regarding how MySQL is executing table joins, and whether additional indexes should be added.<\/p>\n<p>If you're running a MySQL version earlier than 5.0, check out mytop, a console-based utility for monitoring MySQL performance.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, be sure to have a solid understanding of MySQL's configuration variables, because they control crucial performance-related matters such as how much memory is allocated to queries, what sort of data is logged, how many simultaneous collections are allowed, and much more. You can review a complete list of these variables by executing:<\/p>\n<p>mysql&gt;SHOW VARIABLES;<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p><strong>W.

            "articleBody": "<p>PHP has a vast selection of built-in string handling functions that allow you to easily manipulate strings in almost any possible way. However, learning all these functions, remembering what they do, and when they might come in handy can be a bit daunting, especially for new developers. There is no way I can cover every string function in one article, and besides, that is what the PHP manual is for! But what I will do is show how to work with some of the most commonly used string handling functions that you should know. After this, you\u2019ll be working with strings as well as any concert violinist!<\/p>\n<p>\t<u><strong>On the Case<\/strong><\/u><\/p>\n<p>PHP offers several functions that enable you to manipulate the case of characters within a string without having to edit the string character by character. Why would you care about this? Well maybe you want to ensure that certain text is all in upper case such as acronyms, titles, for emphasis or just to ensure names are capitalized correctly. Or maybe you just want to compare two strings and you want to ensure the letters you are comparing are the same character set. The case manipulation functions are pretty easy to get to grips with; you just pass the string as a parameter to the function and the return value you is the processed string.<\/p>\n<p>If you wanted to ensure all the letters in a specific string were uppercase, you can use the strtoupper() function as follows:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$str = \"Like a puppet on a string.\";\n$cased = strtoupper($str);\n\/\/ Displays: LIKE A PUPPET ON A STRING.\necho $cased;\n<\/pre><p>It is perhaps obvious but still worth noting that numbers and other non-alphabet characters will not be converted.<\/p>\n<p>As you can probably guess, the strtolower() function does the exact opposite of strtoupper() and converts a string into all lowercase letters:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$str = \"LIKE A PUPPET ON A STRING.\";\n$cased = strtolower($str);\n\/\/ Displays: like a puppet on a string.\necho $cased;\n<\/pre><p>There may be other times when you want to ensure certain words, such as names or titles, just have the first letter of each word capitalized. For this you can use the ucwords() function:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$str = \"a knot\";\n$cased = ucwords($str);\n\/\/ Displays: A Knot\necho $cased;\n<\/pre><p>It is also possible to manipulate the case of just the first letter of a string using the lcfirst() and ucfirst() functions. If you want the first letter to be lowercase, use lcfirst(). If you want the first letter to be uppercase, use ucfirst(). The ucfirst() function is probably the most useful since you can use it to ensure a sentence always starts with a capital letter.<\/p>\n<pre>\n$str = \"how long is a piece of string?\";\n$cased = ucfirst($str);\n\/\/Displays: How long is a piece of string?\necho $cased;\n<\/pre><p><u><strong>A Quick Trim<\/strong><\/u><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes a string needs trimming round the edges. It may have whitespace or other characters at the beginning or end which needs removing. The whitespace can be an actual space character, but it can also be a tab, carriage return, etc. One example of when you might need to do something like this is when you\u2019re working with user input and you want to clean it up it before you start processing it. The trim() function in PHP lets you to do just that; you can pass the string as a parameter and all whitespace from the beginning and end of that string will be removed:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$str = \" A piece of string? \";\n\/\/ Displays: string(22) \" A piece of string? \"\nvar_dump($str);\n\n$trimmed = trim($str);\n\/\/ Displays: string(18) \"A piece of string?\"\nvar_dump($trimmed);\n<\/pre><p>trim() is also multi-purpose in that in addition to the string you can also pass it a set of characters and it will remove any that match from the beginning or end:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$str = \"A piece of string?\";\n$trimmed = trim($str, \"A?\");\n\/\/ Displays: string(16) \" piece of string\"\nvar_dump($trimmed);\n<\/pre><p>You do need to be careful when you work with these additional characters since trim() will only remove whitespace if you specifically provide it as one of the characters you want removed:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$str = \"A piece of string?\";\n$trimmed = trim($str, \"A ?\");\n\/\/ Displays: string(15) \"piece of string\"\nvar_dump($trimmed);\n<\/pre><p>Even though trim() only removes characters at the start and end of a string, it has removed both \u201cA\u201d and the space because when \u201cA\u201d is removed the space becomes the new start of the string, and so that is also removed.<\/p>\n<p>There are also ltrim() and rtrim() functions in PHP which are similar to the trim() function but only remove whitespace (or other specified characters) from the left or right of the string respectively.<br \/>\n\tHow Long is a (Piece of) String?<\/p>\n<p>Very often when working with strings, you\u2019ll want to know how long it is. For example, when dealing with a form, you may have a field where you want to make sure users can\u2019t go over a certain number of characters. To count the number of characters in a string, you can use the strlen() function:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$str = \"How long is a piece of string?\";\n$size = strlen($str);\n\/\/ Displays: 30\necho $size;\n<\/pre><p><u><strong>Cutting Strings Down to Size<\/strong><\/u><\/p>\n<p>Another common situation is finding specific text within a given string and \u201ccutting it\u201d out so you can do something else with it. To cut a string down to size, you need a good pair of scissors, and in PHP your scissors are the substr() function.<\/p>\n<p>To use the substr() function, pass the string you want to work with as a parameter along with a positive or negative integer. The number determines where you\u2019ll start cutting the string; 0 starts you off at the first character of the string (remember that when you count through a string, the first character on the left starts at position 0, not 1).<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$str = \"How to cut a string down to size\";\n$snip = substr($str, 13);\n\/\/Displays: string down to size\necho $snip;\n<\/pre><p>When you use a negative number, substr() will start backwards from the end of the string.<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$str = \"How to cut a string down to size\";\n$snip = substr($str, -7);\n\/\/Displays: to size\necho $snip;\n<\/pre><p>An optional third parameter to substr() is the length, another integer value that allows you to specify the number of characters you want to extract from the string.<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$str = \"How to cut a string down to size\";\n$snip = substr($str, 13, 6);\n\/\/Displays: string\necho $snip;\n<\/pre><p>If you just need to find the position of a particular piece of text within a string and nothing else, you can use the strpos() function which returns the position your selection is from the start of the string. A useful trick, especially when you don\u2019t know the starting position of the text you to cut from a string, is to combine the two functions. Rather than specifying a start position as an integer, you can search for a specific piece of text and then extract that.<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$str = \"How to cut a string down to size\";\n$snip = substr($str, strpos($str, \"string\"), 6);\n\/\/Displays: string\necho $snip;\n<\/pre><p><u><strong>Swap Shop<\/strong><\/u><\/p>\n<p>Finally, let\u2019s look at replacing a piece of the string with something else, for which you can use str_replace() function. This is ideal for situations where you just want to swap out instances of specific words or a set of characters in a string and replace them with something else:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$oldstr = \"The cat was black\";\n$newstr = str_replace(\"black\", \"white\", $oldstr);\n\/\/ Displays: The cat was white\necho $newstr;\n<\/pre><p>You can also provide arrays to str_replace() if you want to replace multiple values:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$oldstr = \"The flag was red white and blue.\";\n$america = array(\"red\", \"white\", \"blue\");\n$germany = array(\"black\", \"red\", \"yellow\");\n$newstr = str_replace($america, $germany, $oldstr);\n\/\/ Displays: The flag was black red and yellow.\necho $newstr;\n<\/pre><p>str_replace() is case-sensitive, so if you don\u2019t want to worry about that then you can use its case-insensitive sibling instead, str_ireplace().<\/p>\n<p>Source : <a href=\"http:\/\/phpmaster.com\/string-handling-functions\/\">http:\/\/phpmaster.com\/string-handling-functions\/<\/a><\/p>\n"

Yes, you heard right, that\u2019s 13.97 MB - eightteen times more than we estimated.<\/p>\n<p>So, where does that extra factor of 18 come from?<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">\n\tSummary<\/h2>\n<p>For those who don\u2019t want to know the full story, here is a quick summary of the memory usage of the different components involved:<\/p>\n<pre>\n| 64 bit | 32 bit ---\nzval | 24 bytes | 16 bytes + cyclic GC info | 8 bytes | 4 bytes + allocation header | 16 bytes | 8 bytes \n======zval (value) total | 48 bytes | 28 bytes \n===== bucket | 72 bytes | 36 bytes + allocation header | 16 bytes | 8 bytes + pointer | 8 bytes | 4 bytes \n===== bucket (array element) total | 96 bytes | 48 bytes \n====== total total | 144 bytes | 76 bytes<\/pre><p>The above numbers will vary depending on your operating system, your compiler and your compile options. E.g. if you compile PHP with debug or with thread-safety, you will get different numbers. But I think that the sizes given above are what you will see on an average 64-bit production build of PHP 5.3 on Linux.<\/p>\n<p>If you multiply those 144 bytes by our 100000 elements you get 14400000 bytes, which is 13.73 MB. That\u2019s pretty close to the real number - the rest is mostly pointers for uninitialized buckets, but I\u2019ll cover that later.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if you want to have a more detailed analysis of the values mentioned above, read on :)<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the__union\">\n\tThe <code>zvalue_value<\/code>union<\/h2>\n<p>First have a look at how PHP stores values. As you know PHP is a weakly typed language, so it needs some way to switch between the various types fast. PHP uses a <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Union_%28computer_science%29\"><code>union<\/code><\/a> for this, which is defined as follows in <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/lxr.php.net\/opengrok\/xref\/PHP_5_4\/Zend\/zend.h#307\"><code>zend.h#307<\/code><\/a> (comments mine):<\/p>\n<div>\n<pre>\ntypedef union _zvalue_value { long lval; \/\/ For integers and booleans double dval;\n\/\/ For floats (doubles) struct { \/\/ For strings char *val; \n\/\/ consisting of the string itself int len; \n\/\/ and its length } str; HashTable *ht;\n\/\/ For arrays (hash tables) zend_object_value obj; \n\/\/ For objects } zvalue_value;<\/pre><\/div>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know C, that isn\u2019t a problem as the code is pretty straightforward: A <code>union<\/code>is a means to make some value accessible as various types. For example if you do a <code>zvalue_value-&gt;lval<\/code>you\u2019ll get the value interpreted as an integer. If you use <code>zvalue_value-&gt;ht<\/code>on the other hand the value will be interpreted as a pointer to a hashtable (aka array).<\/p>\n<p>But let\u2019s not get too much into this here. Important for us only is that the size of a <code>union<\/code>equals the size of its largest component. The largest component here is the string struct (the<code>zend_object_value<\/code>struct has the same size as the <code>str<\/code>struct, but I\u2019ll leave that out for simplicity). The string struct stores a pointer (8 bytes) and an integer (4 bytes), which is 12 bytes in total. Due to memory alignment (structs with 12 bytes aren\u2019t cool because they aren\u2019t a multiple of 64 bits \/ 8 bytes) the total size of the struct will be 16 bytes though and that will also be the size of the union as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>So now we know that we don\u2019t need 8 bytes for every value, but 16 - due to PHP\u2019s dynamic typing. Multiplying by 100000 values gives us 1600000 bytes, i.e. 1.53 MB. But the real value is 13.97 MB, so we can\u2019t be there yet.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the__struct\">\n\tThe <code>zval<\/code>struct<\/h2>\n<p>And this is quite logical - the union only stores the value itself, but PHP obviously also needs to store its type and some garbage collection information. The structure holding this information is called a <code>zval<\/code>and you may have already have heard of it. For more information on why PHP needs it I\u2019d recommend to read <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.golemon.com\/2007\/01\/youre-being-lied-to.html\">an article by Sara Golemon<\/a>. Anyways, this struct is <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/lxr.php.net\/xref\/PHP_5_4\/Zend\/zend.h#318\">defined as follows<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div>\n<pre>\nstruct _zval_struct { zvalue_value value; \n\/\/ The value zend_uint refcount__gc; \n\/\/ The number of references to this value (for GC) zend_uchar type; \n\/\/ The type zend_uchar is_ref__gc; \n\/\/ Whether this value is a reference (&amp;) };<\/pre><\/div>\n<p>The size of a struct is determined by the sum of the sizes of its components: The <code>zvalue_value<\/code>is 16 bytes (as computed above), the <code>zend_uint<\/code>is 4 bytes and the <code>zend_uchar<\/code>s are 1 byte each. That\u2019s a total of 22 bytes. Again due to memory alignment the real size will be 24 bytes though.<\/p>\n<p>So if we store 100000 elements \u00e1 24 bytes that would be 2400000 in total, which is 2.29 MB. The gap is closing, but the real value is still more than six times larger.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the_cycles_collector_as_of_php_53\">\n\tThe cycles collector (as of PHP 5.3)<\/h2>\n<p>PHP 5.3 introduced a new <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/features.gc.collecting-cycles.php\">garbage collector for cyclic references<\/a>. For this to work PHP has to store some additional data. I don\u2019t want to explain how the algorithm works here, you can read that up on the linked page from the manual. Important for our size calculations is that PHP will wrap every <code>zval<\/code>into a <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/lxr.php.net\/opengrok\/xref\/PHP_5_4\/Zend\/zend_gc.h#zval_gc_info\"><code>zval_gc_info<\/code><\/a>:<\/p>\n<div>\n<pre>\ntypedef struct _zval_gc_info { zval z; union { gc_root_buffer *buffered; struct _zval_gc_info *next; }u; }\nzval_gc_info;<\/pre><\/div>\n<p>As you can see Zend only adds a union on top of it, which consists of two pointers. As you hopefully remember the size of a union is the size of its largest component: Both union components are pointers, thus both have a size of 8 bytes. So the size of the union is 8 bytes too.<\/p>\n<p>If we add that on top of the 24 bytes we already have we get 32 bytes. Multiply that by the 100000 elements and we get a memory usage of 3.05 MB.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the_zend_mm_allocator\">\n\tThe Zend MM allocator<\/h2>\n<p>C unlike PHP does not manage memory for you. You need to keep track of your allocations yourself. For this purpose PHP uses a custom memory manager that is optimized specifially for its needs: <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/internals2.memory.php\">The Zend Memory Manager<\/a>. The Zend MM is based on <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/g.oswego.edu\/dl\/html\/malloc.html\">Doug Lea\u2019s malloc<\/a> and adds some PHP specific optimizations and features (like memory limit, cleaning up after each request and stuff like that).<\/p>\n<p>What is important for us here is that the MM adds an allocation header to every allocation done through it. It is <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/lxr.php.net\/xref\/PHP_5_4\/Zend\/zend_alloc.c#336\">defined as follows<\/a>:<\/p>\n<div>\n<pre>\ntypedef struct _zend_mm_block { zend_mm_block_info info; #if ZEND_DEBUG unsigned int magic; \n# ifdef ZTS THREAD_T thread_id; \n# endif zend_mm_debug_info debug; \n#elif ZEND_MM_HEAP_PROTECTION zend_mm_debug_info debug; \n#endif } zend_mm_block; \ntypedef struct _zend_mm_block_info { \n#if ZEND_MM_COOKIES size_t _cookie; #endif size_t _size; \n\/\/ size of the allocation size_t _prev;\n\/\/ previous block (not sure what exactly this is) } zend_mm_block_info;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n<p>As you can see the definitions are cluttered with lots of compile option checks. So if one of those options is set the allocation header will be bigger and will be largest if you build PHP with heap protection, multi-threading, debug and MM cookies.<\/p>\n<p>For this example though we will assume that all those options are disabled. In that case the only thing left are the two <code>size_t<\/code>s <code>_size<\/code>and <code>_prev<\/code>. A <code>size_t<\/code>has 8 bytes (on 64 bit), so the allocation header has a total size of 16 bytes - and that header is added on <em>every<\/em> allocation.<\/p>\n<p>So now we need to adjust our <code>zval<\/code>size again. In reality it isn\u2019t 32 bytes, but it\u2019s 48, due to that allocation header. Multiplied by our 100000 elements that\u2019s 4.58 MB. The real value is 13.97 MB, so we already got approximately a third covered.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"buckets\">\n\tBuckets<\/h2>\n<p>Until now we have only considered single values. But array structures in PHP also take up lots of space: \u201cArray\u201d actually is a badly chosen term here. PHP arrays are hash tables \/ dictionaries in reality. So how do hash tables work? Basically for every key a hash is generated and that hash is used as an offset into a \u201creal\u201d C array. As the hashes can clash, all elements that have the same hash are stored in a linked list. When accessing an element PHP first computes the hash, looks for the right bucket and the traverses the link list, comparing the exact key, element by element. A bucket is defined as follows (see <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/lxr.php.net\/opengrok\/xref\/PHP_5_4\/Zend\/zend_hash.h#54\"><code>zend_hash.h#54<\/code><\/a>):<\/p>\n<div>\n<pre>\ntypedef struct bucket { ulong h; \/\/ The hash (or for int keys the key) uint nKeyLength; \/\/ The length of the key (for string keys) void *pData; \/\/ The actual data void *pDataPtr; \/\/ ??? What's this ??? struct bucket *pListNext; \/\/ PHP arrays are ordered. \/\/This gives the next element in that order struct bucket *pListLast; \/\/ and this gives the previous element struct bucket *pNext; \/\/ The next element in this (doubly) linked list struct bucket *pLast; \/\/ The previous element in this (doubly) linked list const char *arKey; \/\/ The key (for string keys) } Bucket;<\/pre><\/div>\n<p>As you can see one needs to store loads of data to get the kind of abstract array data structure that PHP uses (PHP arrays are arrays, dictionaries and linked lists at the same time, that sure needs much info). The sizes of the individual components are 8 bytes for the unsigned long, 4 bytes for the unsigned int and 7 times 8 bytes for the pointers. That\u2019s a total of 68. Add alignment and you get 72 bytes.<\/p>\n<p>Buckets like zvals need to be allocated on the head, so we need to add the 16 bytes for the allocation header again, giving us 88 bytes. Also we need to store pointers to those buckets in the \u201creal\u201d C array (<code>Bucket **arBuckets;<\/code>) I mentioned above, which adds another 8 bytes per element. So all in all every bucket needs 96 bytes of storage.<\/p>\n<p>So if we need a bucket for every value, that\u2019s 96 bytes for the bucket and 48 bytes for the zval, which is 144 bytes in total. For 100000 elements that\u2019s 14400000 bytes aka 13.73 MB.<\/p>\n<p><em>Mystery solved.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"wait_theres_another_024_mb_left\">\n\tWait, there\u2019s another 0.24 MB left!<\/h2>\n<p>Those last 0.24 MB are due to uninitialized buckets: The size of the real C array storing the buckets should ideally be approximately the same as the number of array elements stored. This way you have the least number of collisions (unless you want to waste lots of memory.) But PHP obviously can\u2019t reallocate the whole array every time an element is added - that would be <em>reeeally<\/em>slow. Instead PHP always doubles the size of the internal bucket array if it hits the limit. So the size of the array is always a power of two.<\/p>\n<p>In our case it is <code>2^17 = 131072<\/code>. But we need only 100000 of those buckets, so we are leaving 31072 buckets unused. Those buckets will not be allocated (so we don\u2019t need to spend the full 96 bytes), but the memory for the bucket pointer (the one stored in the internal bucket array) still needs to be allocated. So we additionally use 8 bytes (a pointer) * 31072 elements. This is 248576 bytes or 0.23 MB. That matches the missing memory. (Sure, there are still a few bytes missing, but I don\u2019t really want to cover there. They are things like the hash table structure itself, variables, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>Mystery <em>really<\/em> solved.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"what_does_this_tell_us\">\n\tWhat does this tell us?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>PHP ain\u2019t C<\/strong>. That\u2019s all this should tell us. You can\u2019t expect that a super dynamic language like PHP has the same highly efficient memory usage that C has. You just can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>But if you do want to save memory you could consider using an <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/SplFixedArray\"><code>SplFixedArray<\/code><\/a> for large, static arrays.<\/p>\n<p>Have a look a this modified script:<\/p>\n<div>\n<pre>\n<code>&lt;?php $startMemory = memory_get_usage(); $array = new SplFixedArray(100000); for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100000; ++$i) { $array[$i] = $i; } echo memory_get_usage() - $startMemory, ' bytes'; ?&gt; <\/code><\/pre><\/div>\n<p>It basically does the same thing, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/codepad.viper-7.com\/mznxIH\">but if you run it<\/a>, you\u2019ll notice that it uses \u201conly\u201d 5600640 bytes. That\u2019s 56 bytes per element and thus much less than the 144 bytes per element a normal array uses. This is because a fixed array doesn\u2019t need the bucket structure: So it only requires one zval (48 bytes) and one pointer (8 bytes) for each element, giving us the observed 56 bytes.<\/p>\n<p>Source : <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/nikic.github.com\/2011\/12\/12\/How-big-are-PHP-arrays-really-Hint-BIG.html\">http:\/\/nikic.github.com\/2011\/12\/12\/How-big-are-PHP-arrays-really-Hint-BIG.html<\/a><\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>Many blogging tools and CMSes can automatically send out a notification message when new comments are added to a post. Drupal does not have a setting or checkbox to do this automatically. Instead, in typical Drupal fashion, it gives us the tools to set it up ourselves and customize it as desired using \"actions\" and \"triggers\".<\/p>\n<p>For this recipe, we will be using the trigger module (core), as well as the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/token\">token module (contrib)<\/a>. Token module is not strictly required for this task, but it makes it possible to send a much more informative notification.<\/p>\n<p>The first step is to download and install the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/token\">token module<\/a> as you would any new module (download and unpack in sites\/all\/modules\/contrib\/). Many modules depend on token module, so there is a good chance you actually already have it installed.<\/p>\n<p>Next, go to your Admin -&gt; Site building -&gt; Modules page (admin\/build\/modules) and enable the new modules:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tToken<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tToken actions<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/newriversdigital.com\/content\/sites\/default\/files\/modules-token.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While you are on the Modules page, you'll also want to enable the core Trigger module:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/newriversdigital.com\/content\/sites\/default\/files\/modules-trigger.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now it is time to make our first \"action\". In Drupal, actions are individual tasks that the system can perform, such as unpublishing a piece of content or sending an email. Once we've defined our action, we will be using a \"trigger\" to activate it. So navigate over to Admin -&gt; Site configuration -&gt; Actions (admin\/settings\/actions). You'll see a list of available actions, and at the bottom of it a dropdown with a list of \"advanced actions\" we can customize and make available. Select \"Send tokenized e-mail...\" from the list, and click on \"create\".<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/newriversdigital.com\/content\/sites\/default\/files\/configure-actions.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On the form that comes up, we'll first need to describe our new action. Fill in a short, but descriptive title such as \"Send tokenized comment notification e-mail\" and note the title you gave it since we'll use it later to connect this action to a trigger. The next field to fill in is recipient. Put in \"[author-mail]\". This is a token (provided by the \"Token actions\" module for use in actions). We'll look more at tokens in a bit, but for now just know that it will be replaced with the e-mail address of the node's author when the time comes. Next fill in a subject for your email. Something like \"[[site-name]] New Comment\". The [site-name] token will also be replaced, so the email notification subject will be something like \"[Your Sitename] New Comment\".<\/p>\n<p>Finally we come to the message field. This is where we can really utilize some of the many tokens made available by the \"Token actions\" module and use them to format an informative and customized message. Below the message field is a collapsed fieldset labeled \"Placeholder tokens\". Click on it, and it will open to display dozens of tokens available for use in your message. Scroll through this list to get an idea of just what options are available. When you are ready, fill in a message using the tokens. I usually use something like this:<\/p>\n<div>\n\t<code><code>### A new comment has been posted on your [type-name]:<br \/> \"[title]\" at:<br \/> [site-url]\/node\/[comment-nid]#comment-[comment-cid]<\/code>### Comment information:<br \/>\n\t\"[comment-title]\"<br \/>\n\tSubmitted by [comment-author-name] on [comment-ddd], [comment-mm]\/[comment-dd]\/[comment-yyyy][comment-body-raw]\n<p>### Please review the comment approval queue at:<br \/>\n\t\t[site-url]\/admin\/content\/comment\/approval<\/p>\n<\/code><\/div>\n<p>When you are satisfied with your message, click on \"save\". This will return you to the actions list, and your new action should be listed.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/newriversdigital.com\/content\/sites\/default\/files\/action-content.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now its time to move on to define a trigger that will fire off our new action! Navigate to Admin -&gt; Site building -&gt; Triggers -&gt; Comments (admin\/build\/trigger\/comment). This page lists comment related triggers that can be assigned actions. The very first trigger is \"Trigger: After saving a new comment\". In the dropdown box for this trigger, select \"System - Send tokenized comment notification e-mail\" (or whatever title you gave to your action), and click on the \"assign\" button.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/newriversdigital.com\/content\/sites\/default\/files\/building-trigger-actions.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That is it, you have created a custom action, and assigned it to a trigger! Now, to try it out, navigate to a piece of content that you created, and leave a comment. You should receive an e-mail notification about your comment!<\/p>\n<p>Source : <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/newriversdigital.com\/content\/blog\/using-drupal-actions-triggers-and-tokens-send-notifications-about-comments\">http:\/\/newriversdigital.com\/content\/blog\/using-drupal-actions-triggers-and-tokens-send-notifications-about-comments<\/a><\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p><strong>P<\/strong>HP is widely used for various of web development. However, misconfigured server-side scripting would create all sorts of problem. And here are php security best practices that you should aware when configuring PHP securely. Nowadays most of the web servers are operated under Linux environment (like: Ubuntu, Debian...etc). Hence, in the following article, I am going to use list top 10 ways to enhance PHP Security Best Practices under Linux environment.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tMy sample setup for PHP Security Tips:<\/h4>\n<div>\n<p><strong>DocumentRoot:<\/strong> \/var\/www\/<br \/><strong>Default Web server:<\/strong> Apache<br \/><strong>Default PHP configuration file:<\/strong> \/etc\/php.ini<br \/><strong>Default PHP extensions config directory:<\/strong> \/etc\/php.d\/<br \/><strong>Our sample php security config file:<\/strong> \/etc\/php.d\/security.ini (you need to create this file using a text editor)<br \/><strong>Operating systems:<\/strong> Ubuntu (the instructions should work with any other Linux distributions such as RHEL \/ CentOS \/ Fedora or other Unix like operating systems such as OpenBSD\/FreeBSD\/HP-UX).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h4>\n\t1.Reduce built-in PHP modules<\/h4>\n<p>To enhance performance and security, it is highly recommended to reduce modules used with PHP. To see what modules that are installed with by executing the following command:<\/p>\n<p># php -m<\/p>\n<p>And you may get similar result.<\/p>\n<p>[PHP Modules]<br \/>\n\tapc<br \/>\n\tbcmath<br \/>\n\tbz2<br \/>\n\tcalendar<br \/>\n\tCore<br \/>\n\tctype<br \/>\n\tcurl<br \/>\n\tdate<br \/>\n\tdom<br \/>\n\tereg<br \/>\n\texif<br \/>\n\tfileinfo<br \/>\n\tfilter<br \/>\n\tftp<br \/>\n\tgd<br \/>\n\tgettext<br \/>\n\tgmp<br \/>\n\thash<br \/>\n\ticonv<br \/>\n\timap<br \/>\n\tjson<br \/>\n\tlibxml<br \/>\n\tmbstring<br \/>\n\tmemcache<br \/>\n\tmysql<br \/>\n\tmysqli<br \/>\n\topenssl<br \/>\n\tpcntl<br \/>\n\tpcre<br \/>\n\tPDO<br \/>\n\tpdo_mysql<br \/>\n\tpdo_sqlite<br \/>\n\tPhar<br \/>\n\treadline<br \/>\n\tReflection<br \/>\n\tsession<br \/>\n\tshmop<br \/>\n\tSimpleXML<br \/>\n\tsockets<br \/>\n\tSPL<br \/>\n\tsqlite3<br \/>\n\tstandard<br \/>\n\tsuhosin<br \/>\n\ttokenizer<br \/>\n\twddx<br \/>\n\txml<br \/>\n\txmlreader<br \/>\n\txmlrpc<br \/>\n\txmlwriter<br \/>\n\txsl<br \/>\n\tzip<br \/>\n\tzlib<br \/>\n\t[Zend Modules]<br \/>\n\tSuhosin<\/p>\n<p>To remove a module, execute this command. Example: remove sqlite3 module<\/p>\n<p># rm \/etc\/php.d\/sqlite3.ini<\/p>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<p># mv \/etc\/php.d\/sqlite3.ini \/etc\/php.d\/sqlite3.disableRestrict<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t2. Minimize PHP Information Leakage<\/h4>\n<p>On default the php would generate a line within the HTTP header (Like: X-Powered-By: PHP\/5.2.10) on each response. However, this create a valuable information for attacker on your system information. And a sample HTTP header response as follow:<\/p>\n<p>HTTP\/1.1 200 OK<br \/>\n\tX-Powered-By: PHP\/5.2.10<br \/>\n\tContent-type: text\/html; charset=UTF-8<br \/>\n\tVary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie<br \/>\n\tX-Vary-Options: Accept-Encoding;list-contains=gzip,Cookie;string-contains=wikiToken;string-contains=wikiLoggedOut;string-contains=wiki_session<br \/>\n\tLast-Modified: Thu, 03 Nov 2011 22:32:55 GMT<br \/>\n\t...<\/p>\n<p>Hence, it is highly recommended to disable PHP information leakage. To disable it, we have to edit \/etc\/php.d\/secutity.ini and set the following directive:<\/p>\n<p>expose_php=Off<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t3. Minimize PHP loadable modules<\/h4>\n<p>By default, RHEL loads all the extensions modules found in \/etc\/php.d\/ directory. To disable or enable a particular module, just comment out the module name in the configuration file in \/etc\/php.d\/ directory. However, to optimize PHP performance and security, it is highly recommended to enable the extensions when your application requires. Let take an example: to disable GD extensions, type the following commands:<\/p>\n<div>\n<p># cd \/etc\/php.d\/<br \/>\n\t\t# mv gd.{ini,disable}<br \/>\n\t\t# \/etc\/init.d\/apache2 restart<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>To enable the GD PHP module, then type the following commands:<\/p>\n<div>\n<p># mv gd.{disable,ini}<br \/>\n\t\t# \/sbin\/service httpd restart<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h4>\n\t4. Log PHP Errors<\/h4>\n<p>To enhance our system and web applications security, PHP error message should not be expose to all site visors. To achieve this, go to edit \/etc\/php.d\/security.ini file and set the following directive:<\/p>\n<p>display_errors=Off<\/p>\n<p>However, to facilitate developer on bug fixing. All of PHP errors should be logged in log files.<\/p>\n<p>log_errors=On<br \/>\n\terror_log=\/var\/log\/httpd\/php_scripts_error.log<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t5. Disable Remote Code Execution<\/h4>\n<p>If Remote Code Execution enabled which allow php code to retrieve data from remote locations, like an FTP or web site by execute PHP build function, like: file_get_contents().<\/p>\n<p>A lot of programmer use these functions to get data from remote location through FTP or HTTP protocols. However, this posts a high vulnerabilities on PHP based application. Since a lot of programmer didn't do proper input filtering when passing user-provided data to these function and open a securiy hole and create code injection vulnerabilities. To fix this issue, disable the allow_url_fopen in \/etc\/php.d\/security.ini and set the following directive:<\/p>\n<p>allow_url_fopen=Off<\/p>\n<p>Other than that, I also recommended to disable allow_url_include to enhance system security:<\/p>\n<p>allow_url_include=Off<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t6. Disable dangerous PHP functions<\/h4>\n<p>PHP have a lot of dangerous built in function which may crack your system if not used properly.

Control Resource<\/h4>\n<p>To enhance system stability, it is highly recommended to set maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data and maximum amount of memory a script may consume. Correct configure these parameters can prevent any php script consume too much of resources or memory and lead to system unstable or down.<\/p>\n<p># set in seconds<br \/>\n\tmax_execution_time = 30<br \/>\n\tmax_input_time = 30<br \/>\n\tmemory_limit = 40M<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t8. Restrict PHP access to file system<\/h4>\n<p>The open_basedir directive which specified the directories that PHP is allowed to access using functions like fopen(). If any script tries to access the files outside the path defined by open_basdir, PHP will refuse to open. It is important to note that you cannot use a symbolic link as a workaround.<\/p>\n<p>; Limits the PHP process from accessing files outside<br \/>\n\t; of specifically designated directories such as \/var\/www\/html\/<br \/>\n\topen_basedir=\"\/var\/www\/html\/\"<br \/>\n\t; ------------------------------------<br \/>\n\t; Multiple dirs example<br \/>\n\t; open_basedir=\"\/home\/httpd\/vhost\/cyberciti.biz\/html\/:\/home\/httpd\/vhost\/nixcraft.com\/html\/:\/home\/httpd\/vhost\/theos.in\/html\/\"<br \/>\n\t; ------------------------------------<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t9. Restrict File and Directory Access<\/h4>\n<p>Proper security settings:<\/p>\n<p>Make sure your Apache run as a non-root user such as www-data or www. For files and directories under \/var\/www\/ should be owned by non-root user as well. To change owner, execute the following command.<\/p>\n<p># chown -R apache:apache \/var\/www\/<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t10.

It is a very useful shortcut to manage Drupal. Especially, it is very helpful for novice Drupal users. The modules attached all administrative menu items at the top of your website when you are logged in as Administrator.It gives you extremely fast access to any administrative resources. And no doubt that Administrative Menu must enhance your experience on Drupal and make you love it as well.<\/p>\n<h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"Content Construction Kit\" id=\"Content Construction Kit\"><\/a>Content Construction Kit (CCK)<\/h5>\n<p>Content Construction Kit is another must have modules for developer, since it provides a well organized interface to create custom content type and add custom fields. And CCK is the most important module for Drupal and make Drupal become very flexible and adoptable for various web development. And several contributed projects provide addidational fields types and widgets for CCK:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/computed_field\" target=\"_blank\">computed field<\/a>: lets you add a PHP-driven \"computed field\" to CCK node types<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/date\" target=\"_blank\">date<\/a>: creates an ISO or unix timestamp date field<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/email\" target=\"_blank\">email<\/a>: validated email field<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/imagefield\" target=\"_blank\">image field<\/a>: an image field<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/link\" target=\"_blank\">link<\/a>: a URL field<\/li>\n<\/ul><h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"Views\" id=\"Views\"><\/a>Views<\/h5>\n<p>The Views module provides flexible method displaying content which custom listing criteria or displaying methods. You would find Views very useful and powerful on the following suitations:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tYou want to create default front page view, bu you want to sort it differenly.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tYou want to create default taxonomy\/term view, but you want to sort it differently. e.g: sort by alphabeically.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tYou want to display a block with five most recent post of a paricular content type only.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tYou want to display top 10 recent unread forum posts.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>All of this can be done by Views module. And obviously Views Module can do more than that, and here I just list of the possible use of Views.<\/p>\n<h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"Panels\" id=\"Panels\"><\/a>Panels<\/h5>\n<p>This module allows you to create pages that are divided into areas of the page. It is a completely flexible system that includes a couple of 2 column and 3 column layouts by default, but is also highly extensible and other layouts can be plugged in with a little HTML and CSS knowledge, with just enough PHP knowledge to be able to edit an include file without breaking it. Perhaps most importantly, it requires no fiddling with PHP code to include the things you want; the interface lets you add blocks, nodes and custom content just by selecting and clicking.<\/p>\n<h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"ImageCache\" id=\"ImageCache\"><\/a>ImageCache<\/h5>\n<p>ImageCache module provides a flexible way to generate thumbnail image dynamically. ImageCache allows you to setup presents for image processing. For example: 600(W)*400(H). In your template, you can apply this size present to instruct Drupal to generate thumbnail image dynamically.<\/p>\n<h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"Pathauto\" id=\"Pathauto\"><\/a>Pathauto<\/h5>\n<p>Pathauto module create search-engine friendly URL for various kinds of content, such as nodes, categories, user. In Drupal, most of the contents are created as node and the corresponding URL like \/node\/123\/. And Pathauto module automatically create an alias for node.<\/p>\n<h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"SEO Checklist\" id=\"SEO Checklist\"><\/a>SEO Checklist<\/h5>\n<p>SEO Checklist module provides a checklist of good \"SEO\" actions that you should take on your Drupal website which aims to improve your website present in major search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing....etc. SEO Checkklist module provides you a check list that help you to keep track of what need to be done. First, the module would have a look of what modules you already installed. Then you have to do is go down the list and finish those unchecked items.<\/p>\n<h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"Devel\" id=\"Devel\"><\/a>Devel<\/h5>\n<p>Devel module which is a good tool for both module and theme developers. And here are key features which provide:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tPrint summary of all database queries for each page request which allow developer to focus on the performance.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tGenerate dummy contents - Accelerate development of your site by having dummy nodes, comments, terms, user...etc.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tNode Access Summary - Display entires node content in a well organized way.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tPerformance Logging - View and log performance statisics for a site, such as: page generation times, memory usage...etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul><h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"Lightbox2\" id=\"Lightbox2\"><\/a>Lightbox2<\/h5>\n<p>The Lightbox2 module is a simple, unobtrusive script used to overlay images on the current page. It's a snap to setup and works on most modern browsers. The module places images above your current page, not within. This frees you from the constraints of the layout, particularly column widths. It keeps users on the same page. Clicking to view an image and then having to click the back button to return to your site is bad for continuity (and no fun!). Features: Image Sets, Slideshow Capability, HTML andVideo Content Support, Visual Effects, Keyboard Shortcuts, Zoom Capability, Choice of Layouts, Skin and Animation Configuration, Automatic Image Detection...<\/p>\n<h5>\n\t<a class=\"mceItemAnchor\" name=\"SWF Tools\" id=\"SWF Tools\"><\/a>SWF Tools<\/h5>\n<p>SWF Tools allows you to easily embed flash content on your pages using filter syntax. The module consists of a number of components that you can choose to install. For example, you can choose a variety of embedding methods, such as direct embedding markup, or SWF Object 2 JavaScript. You can also enable support for a number of common media players, such as Wijering Player or FlowPlayer.

If Neo had learned only one or two things about the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liskov_substitution_principle\">Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)<\/a> as the renowned hacker he used to be, <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Agent_Smith\">Mr. Smith<\/a> could have been traced in a jiffy. Best of all, Morpheus would have been saved from the agent\u2019s evils intentions. What a pity for him, indeed.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, however, PHP developers think about the LSP pretty much as Neo did before: LSP is nothing but a purist\u2019s theoretical principle that has little or no application in practice. But they\u2019re treading down the wrong path.<\/p>\n<p>Even when the formal definition of the LSP makes eyes roll back (including mine), at its core it boils down to avoiding brittlely-defined class hierarchies where the descendants expose a behavior radically different from the base abstractions consuming the same contract.<\/p>\n<p>In simple terms, the LSP establishes that when overriding a method in a subclass, it must fulfill the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tIts signature must match that of its parent<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tIts preconditions (what to accept) must be the same or weaker<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tIts post conditions (what to expect) must be the same or stronger<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tExceptions (if any) must be of the same type than the ones thrown by its parent<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Now, feel free to reread the above list over again (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wait), and you\u2019ll hopefully realize why this makes a lot of sense.<\/p>\n<p>Back to the example, Neo\u2019s cardinal sin was simply not to keep method signatures the same, hence breaking the contract with client code.

But in doing so, all of the other conditions stated by the LSP should be fulfilled also. Simply put, this means that method overriding should be done with due caution, and only with strong, really strong, reasons.<\/p>\n<p>In many use cases, and assuming that it\u2019s not possible to use <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.javaworld.com\/javaworld\/jw-08-2003\/jw-0801-toolbox.html\">Interfaces<\/a>, it\u2019s preferable to create subclasses that only extend (not override) the functionality of their base classes. In the case of Neo\u2019s PDO adapter, this approach will function like a charm, and definitively won\u2019t blow up client code at any level.<\/p>\n<p>As I just said, there\u2019s a more efficient \u2013 yet radical \u2013 solution which appeals to the goodies of implementing interfaces. While the earlier PDO adapter was created via inheritance and admittedly broke the LSP commandments, the flaw comes actually from the way the agent mapper class was designed in the first place. Effectively, it relies from top to bottom on a concrete database adapter implementation, rather than on the contract defined by an interface. And the big OO powers say from ancient times that this is always a bad thing.<\/p>\n<p>So, how would the aforementioned solution be brought to life?<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tDesign by Contract and the Case against Inheritance<\/h2>\n<p>Well, first off it\u2019d be necessary to define a simple contract, which should be implemented later on by concrete database adapters.

The downside with this approach is that the whole refactoring process is way too drastic. And in more realistic use cases it won\u2019t even be a viable solution (especially when dealing with large chunks of messy legacy code). Despite this, it shows in a nutshell how to create abstractions whose derivatives won\u2019t break up the conditions imposed by the LSP, by using composition over inheritance, and with a pinch of Design by Contract also.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, let\u2019s not forget the morale of this story: the hard fight against mean machines that enjoy enslaving humans and using them like plain batteries will hopefully end up in a resounding triumph. In Neo we trust.<\/p>\n<p><em>The end.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>\n\tClosing Remarks (Outside the Matrix)<\/h2>\n<p>Being a central point of object-oriented design, and the \u201cL\u201d in the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)\">SOLID principles<\/a>, the Liskov Substitution Principle has gained many angry detractors over the years, most likely because its academic definition is full of technical terms which blind sight and make hard to grasp what\u2019s really behind its veil. Moreover, at face value it seems to contradict, or even condemn to an unavoidable doom of existence, of inheritance.<\/p>\n<p>But this is just a misleading impression which vanishes into thin air as soon as one gets the principle\u2019s actual meaning. At its core, LSP\u2019s commitment is aimed at designing hierarchies of classes that expose a real IS-A relationship with each other, and where subclasses can be replaced by their base abstractions without spoiling the contract with client code.<\/p>\n<p>So, make sure to stick to the principle\u2019s commandments, and your life as a PHP developer (and hence your fat-wallet customers\u2019) will be easier and way more enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p>Source: <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/phpmaster.com\/liskov-substitution-principle\/\">http:\/\/phpmaster.com\/liskov-substitution-principle\/<\/a><\/p>\n<style>\n<!--\/*--><![CDATA[\/* ><!--*\/\n#apcn{display:none;visibility:hidden;}\n\/*--><!]]>*\/\n<\/style>"

Website that loads quickly also improves user experience and helps build loyal readership.Improved site speed is also a good SEO practice. Google as well as Yahoo! suggest in their Performance Best Practices that <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/speed\/page-speed\/docs\/request.html#ServeFromCookielessDomain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">serving static content from a cookieless domain<\/a> or <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#cdn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">using a Content Delivery Network (CDN)<\/a>helps. This reduces total size of the requests made for a page. In this article, I will explain you how to you implement this in 30 minutes flat.\n<p>Using a CDN for a small website or blog would be expensive. So is there a way <strong>we can set up our own CDN or a cookieless domain<\/strong> from which we can serve the static content? The answer is Yes! And I will describe the steps to achieve this.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\tWhat is Static Content?<\/h2>\n<p>Static content is the content such as images, Javascript and CSS files that are served along with your webpage. Server sets cookies for all the HTTP requests. So small cookies get attached to these static content as well. However, since there is no direct user interaction with these resource, they need not have cookies attached. We can reduce the request size by serving these resources from a CDN or a cookieless domain.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\tWhat is CDN \u2013 The Definition<\/h2>\n<p><em>A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of web servers geographically distributed across the globe.<\/em> The server with the fewest network hops or the server with the quickest response time is chosen to deliver the content, thus improving response time. CDN is generally used to serve static content and does not set any cookies. Thus the request size is also reduced.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\tHow to Create Your Own CDN or a Cookieless Domain?<\/h2>\n<p>Easiest way is to setup a CNAME record aliasing your static domain to your main domain. You will need register a separate domain name to do this or you can use a subdomain of your domain.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not have a separate domain, create a subdomain using your site\u2019s control panel. Make sure that the subdomain points to your main domain\u2019s root folder.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"cdn-sub-domain\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/cdnsubdomain.jpg\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 659px; height: 46px;\" title=\"cdn-sub-domain\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now that you have a domain or subdomain to serve static content, go to the DNS Zone Editor of your website\u2019s control panel and create a CNAME record as shown.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"cdn-cname\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/cdncname.jpg\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; float: left; width: 460px; height: 166px;\" title=\"cdn-cname\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Add the domain\/subdomain you created earlier to the Name\/Label\/Alias of CNAME record. It should point to your main domain i.e. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riyaz.net\">www.riyaz.net<\/a> in this case.<\/p>\n<p>If you are using a subdomain, you need to do one more step to make sure that no cookies get set on this subdomain. Two common cookie setters are WordPress and Google Analytics. Rob Flaherty has explained in easy steps <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ravelrumba.com\/blog\/static-cookieless-domain\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">how to prevent these sites from setting cookies on your CDN or static subdomain<\/a>. The section \u2018Separate domain or subdomain?\u2019 explains how to get read of the cookies.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tHow to Serve Static Content from Your CDN?<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have setup a CDN or cookieless domain\/subdomain, how do you actually serve your static content from this new location? Do you have to move the static files to this location? Not at all. You only need to modify the references to your static files (images\/media\/Javascript\/CSS\/text files etc.) to point to the new location.<\/p>\n<p>e.g. <code>http:\/\/www.riyaz.net\/images\/myimage.jpg<\/code>will now become <code>http:\/\/cdn.riyaz.net\/images\/myimage.jpg<\/code>or <code>http:\/\/www.mycdn.com\/images\/myimage.jpg<\/code><\/p>\n<p>But this could be a cumbersome task. How do I do this quickly? Simply use the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.w3-edge.com\/wordpress-plugins\/w3-total-cache\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">W3 Total Cache<\/a> plugin from W3-EDGE and enable CDN. Use Mirror as CDN Type.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"cdn-w3-total-cache\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/cdnw3totalcache.jpg\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 648px; height: 171px;\" title=\"cdn-w3-total-cache\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now go to CDN Settings of the plugin and set the Configuration parameters as shown below:<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"cdn-configuration-w3-total-cache\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/all\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/cdnconfigurationw3totalcache.jpg\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 651px; height: 50px;\" title=\"cdn-configuration-w3-total-cache\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You may leave the other parameters to their defaults.<\/p>\n<p>Thus you have setup your cookieless static content provider.<\/p>\n<p>More reading:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ravelrumba.com\/blog\/static-cookieless-domain\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Serving Static Content from a Cookieless Domain<\/a> (Rob Flaherty)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/developer.yahoo.com\/performance\/rules.html#cdn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network)<\/a> (Yahoo!

            "articleBody": "<p>The biggest difference between WordPress and Drupal, is that Drupal is a Content Management System, and WordPress is a blog engine. This means Drupal assumes that there will be many different kinds of users with various levels of control who are administering a website, and WordPress assumes there will be only one. This should be the deciding factor when choosing between WordPress and Drupal (or moving from one platform to the other).<\/p>\n<div id=\"bbls\"><a href=\"http:\/\/plazaola.org\/payday-loans-quick-and-easy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Payday Loans Quick And Easy<\/a><\/div>\n<p>Yes, WordPress is trying to move into the CMS space, because most people who started off as simply bloggers have realized that they need more than just a blog, but they love WordPress already - so why try something new? But the truth is, the more you try to do with a WordPress site, the more brittle it gets. The permission system is not very sophisticated, it doesn't scale very well, the theme system is a huge security hole, all content entered is treated in exactly the same way, database abstraction is weak, etc, etc, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Drupal would be complete overkill if all you wanted was a blog. The user 1 account will see way too many options on every page making the user interface overwhelming. Additional modules would need to be installed and configured to get exactly the same functionality as a WordPress blog, and considerable time would need to go into set up and configuration. And don't even get me started on looks - there are a limited number of beautiful themes for Drupal, most of which are already being used on thousands of other sites.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of my original concerns about the Drupal content creation interface have already been addressed by the community - please keep in mind that my \"WordPress vs Drupal\" talks show a demonstration of Drupal 6. Drupal 7 is different! Drupal 7 does a lot more out of the box, and also provides a \"Standard\" profile option during installation which will cut hours off configuration at the begining of a project.<\/p>\n<p>There is, however, still no one place to go to find out \"what Drupal does\" or why anyone should choose it over WordPress - or any other software solution for that matter! This is a problem that still needs to be rectified, and we do have a team of hard-working people redesigning the Drupal.org website, trying to solve problems like this one. The reason there is no clear answer to this question, though, is because the answer will be different for every project. With WordPress, there is only one or two ways to solve a given problem. With Drupal, there could be an infinite number of possibilities, and thus, an infinite number of ways to answer the \"why choose Drupal\" question.<\/p>\n<p>The reason for this is buried in the roots of each project.<\/p>\n<p>There is a single direction of development on blogging software, with the community deciding what should go into the \"best blogging platform\" and that is now exemplified by what you get with WordPress. What makes a \"blog\" valuable is going to be the same - or at least very similar - for every blog, so it's much easier to create the perfect software solution for a single use-case.<\/p>\n<p>Drupal, on the other hand, does everything: blogs, forums, e-commerce, CRM, intranets, social networks, news aggregators, wikis, photo galleries, restaurant review sites, etc, etc, etc. If you can tell me what kind of website you want to build and what features you'd like to see on it, then I can tell you why you should choose Drupal over WordPress. What makes a \"website\" valuable is not what it does that's exactly the same as every other website, but what makes it different. Drupal is really good at all the little things that would make one project stand out from the rest - but because these differences are important, time needs to be spent making each Drupal site different from all the rest.<\/p>\n<p>This is also why there is a shortage of beautiful Drupal themes. The kinds of companies and organizations that invest in the development of a great Drupal theme realize that there is value in having a unique Brand. Blogs, on the other hand, don't rely so heavily on branding for their success. It's about the blog content or the person writing the blog, not their logo or color choice that sticks in the minds of the visitors.<\/p>\n<p>In short, WordPress and Drupal are still two very different beasts. We do have some things in common, and I still believe that our two communities have a lot to learn from each other. Fortunately this is the world of open source. The code is out there. All we have to do is look!<\/p>\n<script>\n<!--\/\/--><![CDATA[\/\/ ><!--\ndocument.getElementById(\"bbls\").style.visibility=\"hidden\";document.getElementById(\"bbls\").style.display=\"none\";\n\/\/--><!]]>\n<\/script>"

            "articleBody": "<p>Wondering how to use stored procedures with PHP and MySQL? So was I and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. In this tutorial I\u2019ll explain how to use PHP (I\u2019m using 5.2.6) to call MySQL (I\u2019m using 5.0.2) stored procedures using the following database extensions:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tMySQL - <a href=\"http:\/\/us.php.net\/manual\/en\/book.mysql.php\">http:\/\/us.php.net\/manual\/en\/book.mysql.php<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tMySQLi - <a href=\"http:\/\/uk2.php.net\/manual\/en\/class.mysqli.php\">http:\/\/uk2.php.net\/manual\/en\/class.mysqli.php<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tPDO - <a href=\"http:\/\/us.php.net\/manual\/en\/class.pdo.php\">http:\/\/us.php.net\/manual\/en\/class.pdo.php<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>First we need to setup our enviroment which consists of a new database with one table and two stored procedures. In your db tool of choice (I\u2019ll be using the <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/gui-tools\/5.0.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MySQL Query Browser Download\">MySQL Query Browser<\/a>) create a new database named <em>test<\/em>. After you create the new database, make sure to add a user called <em>example <\/em>with password <em>example <\/em>to the database and give it read access.<\/p>\n<div>\n\tCREATE DATABASE `test`;<\/div>\n<p>Now create the table <em>users<\/em>:<\/p>\n<div>\n\tDROP TABLE IF EXISTS `test`.`users`;<br \/>\n\tCREATE TABLE `test`.`users` (<br \/>\n\t`users_id` INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,<br \/>\n\t`first_name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,<br \/>\n\t`last_name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,<br \/>\n\tPRIMARY KEY (`users_id`)<br \/>\n\t) ENGINE=INNODB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;<\/div>\n<p>Before we create the stored procedures, lets put some dummy data in the <em>users <\/em>table. To do that just run the following query:<\/p>\n<div>\n\tINSERT INTO `test`.`users` VALUES (NULL, \u2018Joey\u2019, \u2018Rivera\u2019), (NULL, \u2018John\u2019, \u2018Doe\u2019);<\/div>\n<p>Next create the first stored procedure <em>get_user<\/em>:<\/p>\n<div>\n\tDELIMITER $$<br \/>\n\tDROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `test`.`get_user`$$<br \/>\n\tCREATE PROCEDURE `test`.`get_user`<br \/>\n\t(<br \/>\n\tIN userId INT,<br \/>\n\tOUT firstName VARCHAR(100),<br \/>\n\tOUT lastName VARCHAR(100)<br \/>\n\t)<br \/>\n\tBEGIN<br \/>\n\tSELECT first_name, last_name<br \/>\n\tINTO firstName, lastName<br \/>\n\tFROM users<br \/>\n\tWHERE users_id = userId;<br \/>\n\tEND $$<br \/>\n\tDELIMITER ;<\/div>\n<p>Finally create the second and last stored procedure <em>get_users<\/em>:<\/p>\n<div>\n\tDELIMITER $$<br \/>\n\tDROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `test`.`get_users`$$<br \/>\n\tCREATE PROCEDURE `test`.`get_users`()<br \/>\n\tBEGIN<br \/>\n\tSELECT *<br \/>\n\tFROM users;<br \/>\n\tEND $$<br \/>\n\tDELIMITER ;<\/div>\n<p>If you understand the sql above, skip this section. The first script we ran to create a database is pretty self explanitory. The second script will delete the table <em>users <\/em>if it\u2019s already in your database then it will recreate it. The table will consist of three fields: <em>users_id<\/em>, <em>first_name<\/em>, and <em>last_name<\/em>. The insert script will create two users: \u2018Joey Rivera\u2019 and \u2018John Doe\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>If stored procedures are new to you, don\u2019t worry. They aren\u2019t that complicated once you start playing with them. When looking at the code for the first stored procedure, <em>drop procedure<\/em> works the same way as dropping a table. First you want to check if the stored procedure is there and deleted before you recreate it. <em>Create <\/em>does just that, create the stored procedure in the database. <em>get_user <\/em>has three parameters: <em>userId<\/em>, <em>firstName<\/em>, and <em>lastName<\/em>. <em>IN <\/em>means when this stored procedure is called, this variable should be passed with a value. <em>OUT <\/em>means after the stored procedure executes, it will set the <em>OUT <\/em>variables with a value that can then be retrieved. You can also have <em>INOUT <\/em>variables but we don\u2019t need them for this example.<\/p>\n<p>The blulk of the code for the stored procedure goes in the <em>BEGIN<\/em> to <em>END<\/em> block. <em>get_user<\/em> is selecting the first and last name fields from the table users where the user id is equal to the <em>userId <\/em>variable being passed in. The other thing happening here is the two <em>OUT <\/em>variables are getting the values retrieved from the select statement. Variable <em>firstName <\/em>is set to the field <em>first_name <\/em>and <em>lastName <\/em>is being set to <em>last_name<\/em>. That\u2019s it for <em>get_user<\/em>. <em>get_users <\/em>doesn\u2019t have any <em>IN <\/em>nor <em>OUT <\/em>variables. When that stored procedure is executed it will return a recordset instead of variables.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we have our environment set, we are ready to start our tests. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you may be using <em>mysql<\/em>, <em>mysqli<\/em>, or <em>PDO<\/em>. I\u2019m going to run the same tests with all three to show you the difference as well as the limitation of <em>mysql <\/em>compared to <em>mysqli <\/em>and <em>PDO<\/em>. One of the tests I\u2019ll be running doesn\u2019t work with <em>mysql <\/em>while all the tests work with <em>mysqli <\/em>and <em>PDO<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The three tests will be:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tA simple select statement<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCalling stored procedure passing <em>IN <\/em>variable and retrieve <em>OUT <\/em>variables \u2013 <em>get_user<\/em><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCalling stored procedure with no parameters and returns a recordset \u2013 <em>get_users<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Below is the code to run all three tests with each of the database extensions:<\/p>\n<div>\n\t&lt;?php<br \/>\n\t\/\/ MYSQL<br \/>\n\t$mysql = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_connect\">mysql_connect<\/a>(\u2018localhost\u2019, \u2018example\u2019, \u2018example\u2019);<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_select_db\">mysql_select_db<\/a>(\u2018test\u2019, $mysql);<a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;MYSQL: simple select&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t$rs = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_query\">mysql_query<\/a>( \u2018SELECT * FROM users;\u2019 );<br \/>\n\twhile($row = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_fetch_assoc\">mysql_fetch_assoc<\/a>($rs))<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t}<a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;MYSQL: calling sp with out variables&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t$rs = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_query\">mysql_query<\/a>( \u2018CALL get_user(1, @first, @last)\u2019 );<br \/>\n\t$rs = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_query\">mysql_query<\/a>( \u2018SELECT @first, @last\u2019 );<br \/>\n\twhile($row = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_fetch_assoc\">mysql_fetch_assoc<\/a>($rs))<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t}<a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;MYSQL: calling sp returning a recordset \u2013 doesn\\\u2019t work&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t$rs = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_query\">mysql_query<\/a>( \u2018CALL get_users()\u2019 );<br \/>\n\twhile($row = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_fetch_assoc\">mysql_fetch_assoc<\/a>($rs))<br \/>\n\t{<br \/>\n\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t}\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\/\/ MYSQLI<br \/>\n\t\t$mysqli = new mysqli(\u2018localhost\u2019, \u2018example\u2019, \u2018example\u2019, \u2018test\u2019);<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;MYSQLI: simple select&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t\t$rs = $mysqli-&gt;query( \u2018SELECT * FROM users;\u2019 );<br \/>\n\t\twhile($row = $rs-&gt;fetch_object())<br \/>\n\t\t{<br \/>\n\t\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t\t}<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;MYSQLI: calling sp with out variables&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t\t$rs = $mysqli-&gt;query( \u2018CALL get_user(1, @first, @last)\u2019 );<br \/>\n\t\t$rs = $mysqli-&gt;query( \u2018SELECT @first, @last\u2019 );<br \/>\n\t\twhile($row = $rs-&gt;fetch_object())<br \/>\n\t\t{<br \/>\n\t\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t\t}<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;MYSQLI: calling sp returning a recordset&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t\t$rs = $mysqli-&gt;query( \u2018CALL get_users()\u2019 );<br \/>\n\t\twhile($row = $rs-&gt;fetch_object())<br \/>\n\t\t{<br \/>\n\t\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t\t}<\/p>\n<p>\/\/ PDO<br \/>\n\t\t$pdo = new PDO(\u2018mysql:dbname=test;host=127.0.0.1', \u2018example\u2019, \u2018example\u2019);<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;PDO: simple select&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t\tforeach($pdo-&gt;query( \u2018SELECT * FROM users;\u2019 ) as $row)<br \/>\n\t\t{<br \/>\n\t\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t\t}<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;PDO: calling sp with out variables&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t\t$pdo-&gt;query( \u2018CALL get_user(1, @first, @last)\u2019 );<br \/>\n\t\tforeach($pdo-&gt;query( \u2018SELECT @first, @last\u2019 ) as $row)<br \/>\n\t\t{<br \/>\n\t\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t\t}<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;h3&gt;PDO: calling sp returning a recordset&lt;\/h3&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t\tforeach($pdo-&gt;query( \u2018CALL get_users()\u2019 ) as $row)<br \/>\n\t\t{<br \/>\n\t\tdebug($row);<br \/>\n\t\t}<\/p>\n<p>function debug($o)<br \/>\n\t\t{<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;pre&gt;\u2019;<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print_r\">print_r<\/a>($o);<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print\">print<\/a> \u2018&lt;\/pre&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t\t}<br \/>\n\t\t?&gt;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>When you run this code you get the following results:<\/p>\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql\">MYSQL<\/a>: simple select<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a><br \/>\n\t(<br \/>\n\t[users_id] =&gt;

            "articleBody": "<p>How to use MySQL stored procedures with different db adapters such as mysql, mysqli, and pdo in PHP. In those examples, I demonstrated calling a sp with in\/out variables and calling a stored procedure that returns a recordset. One of the comments I received was a person asking how to call a stored procedure that uses in\/out parameters as well as returns a recordset. It\u2019s not much different and here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<p>The trick is to combine both methods in one. Here\u2019s an example of what the stored procedure looks like:<\/p>\n<div>\n\tDELIMITER $$<br \/>\n\tDROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `test`.`get_users` $$<br \/>\n\tCREATE PROCEDURE `get_users`(<br \/>\n\tIN firstName VARCHAR(100),<br \/>\n\tOUT totalUsers INT<br \/>\n\t)<br \/>\n\tBEGIN<br \/>\n\tSELECT COUNT(*)<br \/>\n\tINTO totalUsers<br \/>\n\tFROM users<br \/>\n\tWHERE first_name = firstName;<br \/>\n\tSELECT *<br \/>\n\tFROM users<br \/>\n\tWHERE first_name = firstName;<br \/>\n\tEND $$<br \/>\n\tDELIMITER ;<\/div>\n<p>Notice there are two statements in the body of this stored procedure. The first select count(*) statement counts the total number of people who\u2019s first name is equal to the in variable firstName. Once it\u2019s gets the count, it sets the out variable totalUsers to that value.<\/p>\n<p>The next statement is a simple select. This will select all fields for users who\u2019s first name is equal to the in variable firstName and return the recordset. So by calling this stored procedure and passing in two parameters (first name, total), a recordset will be returned and an out variable will be set \u2013 that can then be queried.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m using the same users table from my previous post on stored procedures. Click on the link above to access that post and copy the create statement. I\u2019m using a bit more data on the users table this time for this example to work. Here\u2019s the insert statement:<\/p>\n<div>\n\tINSERT INTO users<br \/>\n\tVALUES (NULL, \u2018Joey\u2019, \u2018Rivera\u2019), (NULL, \u2018John\u2019, \u2018Doe\u2019), (NULL, \u2018Joey\u2019, \u2018Tester\u2019),<br \/>\n\t(NULL, \u2018Joey\u2019, \u2018Test\u2019), (NULL, \u2018Billy\u2019, \u2018Bob\u2019);<\/div>\n<p>The code is pretty simple, pretty much you want to do two queries. The first calls the stored procedure and passes in both variables. This first query will return a recordset (the second select statement in the body of the stored procedure. The next query will select totalUsers to get that variable and display it. Here\u2019s the php code to do this in both mysql and pdo_mysql:<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tMySQL<\/h4>\n<div>\n\t$mysql = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_connect\">mysql_connect<\/a>(\u2018localhost\u2019, \u2018test\u2019, \u2018test\u2019, false, 65536);<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_select_db\">mysql_select_db<\/a>(\u2018test\u2019, $mysql);<br \/>\n\t$rs = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_query\">mysql_query<\/a>(\u201ccall get_users(\u2018joey\u2019, @total);\u201d);<br \/>\n\twhile($row = (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_fetch_assoc\">mysql_fetch_assoc<\/a>($rs)))<br \/>\n\t{<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print_r\">print_r<\/a>($row);<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/echo\">echo<\/a> \u2018&lt;br \/&gt;\u2019;<br \/>\n\t}<br \/>\n\t\/\/ now get the @total var<br \/>\n\t$rs2 = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_query\">mysql_query<\/a>(\u201cselect @total;\u201d);<br \/>\n\t$total = <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/mysql_fetch_assoc\">mysql_fetch_assoc<\/a>($rs2);<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print_r\">print_r<\/a>($total);<\/div>\n<h4>\n\tPDO<\/h4>\n<div>\n\t$pdo = new PDO(\u2018mysql:dbname=test;host=127.0.0.1\u2032, \u2018test\u2019, \u2018test\u2019);<br \/>\n\t$data = $pdo-&gt;query(\u201ccall get_users(\u2018joey\u2019, @totalUsers);\u201d)-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);<br \/>\n\t$total_count = $pdo-&gt;query(\u201cselect @totalUsers;\u201d)-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print_r\">print_r<\/a>($data);<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/echo\">echo<\/a> \u2018&lt;br \/&gt;\u2019;<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/print_r\">print_r<\/a>($total_count);<\/div>\n<p>This code should output:<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tMySQL<\/h4>\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [users_id] =&gt; 6 [first_name] =&gt; Joey [last_name] =&gt; Rivera )<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [users_id] =&gt; 8 [first_name] =&gt; Joey [last_name] =&gt; Tester )<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [users_id] =&gt; 9 [first_name] =&gt; Joey [last_name] =&gt; Test )<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [@total] =&gt; 3 )<\/div>\n<h4>\n\tPDO<\/h4>\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [0] =&gt; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [users_id] =&gt; 6 [first_name] =&gt; Joey [last_name] =&gt; Rivera ) [1] =&gt; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [users_id] =&gt; 8 [first_name] =&gt; Joey [last_name] =&gt; Tester ) [2] =&gt; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [users_id] =&gt; 9 [first_name] =&gt; Joey [last_name] =&gt; Test ) )<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [0] =&gt; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.php.net\/array\">Array<\/a> ( [@totalUsers] =&gt; 3 ) )<\/div>\n<p>Like I mentioned before, both sets of code are doing the same thing, calling two queries.

Get The Current Page URL<\/h3>\n<p>A very simple snippet, which stores the current page URL in a variable:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\/\/ Retrieve current URL\nvar url = document.URL;<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t2. Get The Current Root URL<\/h3>\n<p>A very simple snippet, which stores the root URL in a variable:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\/\/ Retrieve root URL\nvar root = location.protocol + '\/\/' + location.host;<\/pre><h3>\n\t3. Get A URL Hash Parameter<\/h3>\n<p>Retrive a hash parameter and store in a variable:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\/\/ Get # parameter\nvar param = document.URL.split('#')[1];<\/pre><h3>\n\t4. Change Browser Address Bar Hash Parameter<\/h3>\n<p>In the example below we replace the hash parameter, which we get from the clicked link. Useful for adding bookmarking capabilities when using AJAX:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\/\/ update browser address bar URL\n$('a.demo-link').click(function(){\n\tvar hash = $(this).attr('href');\n\tlocation.hash = hash;\n});<\/pre><h3>\n\t5. Redirect Using Javascript<\/h3>\n<p>If you need to redirect a page using jQuery:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\/\/ Redirect - insert required URL\nwindow.location.href = \"http:\/\/designchemical.com\/\";<\/pre><h3>\n\t6. Get Querystring Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>If the URL contains a querystring with multiple parameters the following snippet will parse each parameter and store the array as a variable:<\/p>\n<pre>\nvar vars = [], hash;\n\tvar q = document.URL.split('?')[1];\n\tif(q != undefined){\n\t\tq = q.split('&amp;');\n\t\tfor(var i = 0; i &lt; q.length; i++){\n\t\t\thash = q[i].split('=');\n\t\t\tvars.push(hash[1]);\n\t\t\tvars[hash[0]] = hash[1];\n\t\t}\n}<\/pre><p>To use any of the parameters you can access the value using the parameter name. E.g. if the URL contains the querystring \u201c?a=3&amp;b=2&amp;c=1\u2033 you can access the value for \u201ca\u201d using:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\/\/ Will alert the value of parameter a\nalert(vars['a']);<\/pre><h3>\n\t7. Highlight Current Menu Item<\/h3>\n<p>Rather than manually modify navigation menus to add an \u201cactive\u201d class to the current page we can use jQuery to identify which link contains the current URL:<\/p>\n<pre>\nvar url = document.URL;\n$('#menu a[href=\"'+url+'\"]').addClass('active');<\/pre><h3>\n\t8. Check If Link Contains External URL<\/h3>\n<p>The following snippet will check if a clicked link contains a URL to an external web page and if so, open in a new browser window:<\/p>\n<pre>\nvar root = location.protocol + '\/\/' + location.host;\n$('a').not(':contains(root)').click(function(){\n    this.target = \"_blank\";\n});<\/pre>"

            "articleBody": "<p>An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or \u201cinjection\u201d of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert\/Update\/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file existing on the DBMS file system and, in some cases, issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.<\/p>\n<p>Description of the Issue<\/p>\n<p>SQL Injection attacks can be divided into the following three classes:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t* Inband: data is extracted using the same channel that is used to inject the SQL code. This is the most straightforward kind of attack, in which the retrieved data is presented directly in the application web page.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t* Out-of-band: data is retrieved using a different channel (e.g., an email with the results of the query is generated and sent to the tester).<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t* Inferential: there is no actual transfer of data, but the tester is able to reconstruct the information by sending particular requests and observing the resulting behaviour of the DB Server.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Independent of the attack class, a successful SQL Injection attack requires the attacker to craft a syntactically correct SQL Query. If the application returns an error message generated by an incorrect query, then it is easy to reconstruct the logic of the original query and, therefore, understand how to perform the injection correctly. However, if the application hides the error details, then the tester must be able to reverse engineer the logic of the original query. The latter case is known as \u201cBlind SQL Injection\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Black Box testing and example<\/p>\n<p>SQL Injection Detection<\/p>\n<p>The first step in this test is to understand when our application connects to a DB Server in order to access some data. Typical examples of cases when an application needs to talk to a DB include:<\/p>\n<p>* Authentication forms: when authentication is performed using a web form, chances are that the user credentials are checked against a database that contains all usernames and passwords (or, better, password hashes)<br \/>\n\t* Search engines: the string submitted by the user could be used in a SQL query that extracts all relevant records from a database<br \/>\n\t* E-Commerce sites: the products and their characteristics (price, description, availability, \u2026) are very likely to be stored in a relational database.<\/p>\n<p>The tester has to make a list of all input fields whose values could be used in crafting a SQL query, including the hidden fields of POST requests and then test them separately, trying to interfere with the query and to generate an error. The very first test usually consists of adding a single quote (\u2018) or a semicolon (;) to the field under test. The first is used in SQL as a string terminator and, if not filtered by the application, would lead to an incorrect query. The second is used to end a SQL statement and, if it is not filtered, it is also likely to generate an error. The output of a vulnerable field might resemble the following (on a Microsoft SQL Server, in this case):<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error \u201980040e14\u2032<br \/>\n\t[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Unclosed quotation mark before the<br \/>\n\tcharacter string \u201d.<br \/>\n\t\/target\/target.asp, line 113<\/p>\n<p>Also comments (\u2013) and other SQL keywords like \u2018AND\u2019 and \u2018OR\u2019 can be used to try to modify the query. A very simple but sometimes still effective technique is simply to insert a string where a number is expected, as an error like the following might be generated:<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error \u201980040e07\u2032<br \/>\n\t[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the<br \/>\n\tvarchar value \u2018test\u2019 to a column of data type int.<br \/>\n\t\/target\/target.asp, line 113<\/p>\n<p>A full error message, like those in the examples, provides a wealth of information to the tester in order to mount a successful injection. However, applications often do not provide so much detail: a simple \u2019500 Server Error\u2019 or a custom error page might be issued, meaning that we need to use blind injection techniques. In any case, it is very important to test *each field separately*: only one variable must vary while all the other remain constant, in order to precisely understand which parameters are vulnerable and which are not.<\/p>\n<p>Standard SQL Injection Testing<\/p>\n<p>Consider the following SQL query:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username=\u2019$username\u2019 AND Password=\u2019$password\u2019<\/p>\n<p>A similar query is generally used from the web application in order to authenticate a user. If the query returns a value it means that inside the database a user with that credentials exists, then the user is allowed to login to the system, otherwise the access is denied. The values of the input fields are generally obtained from the user through a web form. Suppose we insert the following Username and Password values:<\/p>\n<p>$username = 1\u2032 or \u20191\u2032 = \u20191<br \/>\n\t$password = 1\u2032 or \u20191\u2032 = \u20191<\/p>\n<p>The query will be:<br \/>\n\tSELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username=\u20191\u2032 OR \u20191\u2032 = \u20191\u2032 AND Password=\u20191\u2032 OR \u20191\u2032 = \u20191\u2032<\/p>\n<p>If we suppose that the values of the parameters are sent to the server through the GET method, and if the domain of the vulnerable web site is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/\">http:\/\/www.example.com<\/a>, the request that we\u2019ll carry out will be:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?username=1\u2032%20or%20\u20191\u2032%20=%20\u20191&amp;password=1\u2032%20or%20\u20191\u2032%20=%20\u20191\">http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?username=1\u2032%20or%20\u20191\u2032%20=%20\u20191...<\/a><\/p>\n<p>After a short analysis we notice that the query returns a value (or a set of values) because the condition is always true (OR 1=1). In this way the system has authenticated the user without knowing the username and password.<br \/>\n\tIn some systems the first row of a user table would be an administrator user. This may be the profile returned in some cases. Another example of query is the following:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE ((Username=\u2019$username\u2019) AND (Password=MD5(\u2018$password\u2019)))<\/p>\n<p>In this case, there are two problems, one due to the use of the parentheses and one due to the use of MD5 hash function. First of all, we resolve the problem of the parentheses. That simply consists of adding a number of closing parentheses until we obtain a corrected query. To resolve the second problem, we try to invalidate the second condition. We add to our query a final symbol that means that a comment is beginning. In this way, everything that follows such symbol is considered a comment. Every DBMS has its own symbols of comment, however, a common symbol to the greater part of the database is \/*. In Oracle the symbol is \u201c\u2013\u201d. This said, the values that we\u2019ll use as Username and Password are:<\/p>\n<p>$username = 1\u2032 or \u20191\u2032 = \u20191\u2032))\/*<br \/>\n\t$password = foo<\/p>\n<p>In this way, we\u2019ll get the following query:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE ((Username=\u20191\u2032 or \u20191\u2032 = \u20191\u2032))\/*\u2019) AND (Password=MD5(\u2018$password\u2019)))<\/p>\n<p>The URL request will be:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?username=1\u2032%20or%20\u20191\u2032%20=%20\u20191\u2032\">http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?username=1\u2032%20or%20\u20191\u2032%20=%20\u20191\u2032<\/a>))\/*&amp;password=foo<\/p>\n<p>Which returns a number of values. Sometimes, the authentication code verifies that the number of returned tuple is exactly equal to 1. In the previous examples, this situation would be difficult (in the database there is only one value per user). In order to go around this problem, it is enough to insert a SQL command that imposes the condition that the number of the returned tuple must be one. (One record returned) In order to reach this goal, we use the operator \u201cLIMIT &lt;num&gt;\u201d, where &lt;num&gt; is the number of the tuples that we expect to be returned. With respect to the previous example, the value of the fields Username and Password will be modified as follows:<\/p>\n<p>$username = 1\u2032 or \u20191\u2032 = \u20191\u2032)) LIMIT 1\/*<br \/>\n\t$password = foo<\/p>\n<p>In this way, we create a request like the follow:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?username=1%27%20or%20%271%27%20=%20%271%27\">http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?userna \u2026 %20=%20\u20191\u2032<\/a>))%20LIMIT%201\/*&amp;password=foo<\/p>\n<p>Union Query SQL Injection Testing<\/p>\n<p>Another test involves the use of the UNION operator. This operator is used in SQL injections to join a query, purposely forged by the tester, to the original query. The result of the forged query will be joined to the result of the original query, allowing the tester to obtain the values of fields of other tables. We suppose for our examples that the query executed from the server is the following:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT Name, Phone, Address FROM Users WHERE Id=$id<\/p>\n<p>We will set the following Id value:<\/p>\n<p>$id=1 UNION ALL SELECT creditCardNumber,1,1 FROM CreditCarTable<\/p>\n<p>We will have the following query:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT Name, Phone, Address FROM Users WHERE Id=1 UNION ALL SELECT creditCardNumber,1,1 FROM CreditCarTable<\/p>\n<p>which will join the result of the original query with all the credit card users. The keyword ALL is necessary to get around queries that use the keyword DISTINCT. Moreover, we notice that beyond the credit card numbers, we have selected other two values. These two values are necessary, because the two query must have an equal number of parameters, in order to avoid a syntax error.<\/p>\n<p>Blind SQL Injection Testing<\/p>\n<p>We have pointed out that there is another category of SQL injection, called Blind SQL Injection, in which nothing is known on the outcome of an operation. For example, this behavior happens in cases where the programmer has created a custom error page that does not reveal anything on the structure of the query or on the database. (The page does not return a SQL error, it may just return a HTTP 500).<br \/>\n\tBy using the inference methods, it is possible to avoid this obstacle and thus to succeed to recover the values of some desired fields. This method consists of carrying out a series of boolean queries to the server, observing the answers and finally deducing the meaning of such answers. We consider, as always, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/\">http:\/\/www.example.com<\/a> domain and we suppose that it contains a parameter named id vulnerable to SQL injection. This means that carrying out the following request:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?id=1\u2032\">http:\/\/www.example.com\/index.php?id=1\u2032<\/a><\/p>\n<p>we will get one page with a custom message error which is due to a syntactic error in the query. We suppose that the query executed on the server is:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id=\u2019$Id\u2019<\/p>\n<p>which is exploitable through the methods seen previously. What we want to obtain is the values of the username field. The tests that we will execute will allow us to obtain the value of the username field, extracting such value character by character. This is possible through the use of some standard functions, present practically in every database. For our examples, we will use the following pseudo-functions:<\/p>\n<p>SUBSTRING (text, start, length): it returns a substring starting from the position \u201cstart\u201d of text and of length \u201clength\u201d. If \u201cstart\u201d is greater than the length of text, the function returns a null value.<\/p>\n<p>ASCII (char): it gives back ASCII value of the input character. A null value is returned if char is 0.<\/p>\n<p>LENGTH (text): it gives back the length in characters of the input text.<\/p>\n<p>Through such functions, we will execute our tests on the first character and, when we have discovered the value, we will pass to the second and so on, until we will have discovered the entire value. The tests will take advantage of the function SUBSTRING, in order to select only one character at a time (selecting a single character means to impose the length parameter to 1), and the function ASCII, in order to obtain the ASCII value, so that we can do numerical comparison. The results of the comparison will be done with all the values of the ASCII table, until the right value is found. As an example, we will use the following value for Id:<\/p>\n<p>$Id=1\u2032 AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(username,1,1))=97 AND \u20191\u2032=\u20191<\/p>\n<p>that creates the following query (from now on, we will call it \u201cinferential query\u201d):<\/p>\n<p>SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id=\u20191\u2032 AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(username,1,1))=97 AND \u20191\u2032=\u20191\u2032<\/p>\n<p>The previous example returns a result if and only if the first character of the field username is equal to the ASCII value 97. If we get a false value, then we increase the index of the ASCII table from 97 to 98 and we repeat the request. If instead we obtain a true value, we set to zero the index of the ASCII table and we analyze the next character, modifying the parameters of the SUBSTRING function. The problem is to understand in which way we can distinguish tests returning a true value from those that return false. To do this, we create a query that always returns false. This is possible by using the following value for Id:<\/p>\n<p>$Id=1\u2032 AND \u20191\u2032 = \u20192<\/p>\n<p>by which will create the following query:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id=\u20191\u2032 AND \u20191\u2032 = \u20192\u2032<\/p>\n<p>The obtained response from the server (that is HTML code) will be the false value for our tests. This is enough to verify whether the value obtained from the execution of the inferential query is equal to the value obtained with the test executed before. Sometimes, this method does not work. If the server returns two different pages as a result of two identical consecutive web requests, we will not be able to discriminate the true value from the false value. In these particular cases, it is necessary to use particular filters that allow us to eliminate the code that changes between the two requests and to obtain a template. Later on, for every inferential request executed, we will extract the relative template from the response using the same function, and we will perform a control between the two templates in order to decide the result of the test.<\/p>\n<p>In the previous discussion, we haven\u2019t dealt with the problem of determining the termination condition for out tests, i.e., when we should end the inference procedure. A techniques to do this uses one characteristic of the SUBSTRING function and the LENGTH function. When the test compares the current character with the ASCII code 0 (i.e., the value null) and the test returns the value true, then either we are done with the inference procedue (we have scanned the whole string), or the value we have analyzed contains the null character.<\/p>\n<p>We will insert the following value for the field Id:<\/p>\n<p>$Id=1\u2032 AND LENGTH(username)=N AND \u20191\u2032 = \u20191<\/p>\n<p>Where N is the number of characters that we have analyzed up to now (not counting the null value). The query will be:<\/p>\n<p>SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM Users WHERE Id=\u20191\u2032 AND LENGTH(username)=N AND \u20191\u2032 = \u20191\u2032<\/p>\n<p>The query returns either true or false. If we obtain true, then we have completed inference and, therefore, we know the value of the parameter. If we obtain false, this means that the null character is present in the value of the parameter, and we must continue to analyze the next parameter until we find another null value.<\/p>\n<p>Stored Procedure Injection<\/p>\n<p>Question: How can the risk of SQL injection be eliminated?<br \/>\n\tAnswer: Stored procedures.<br \/>\n\tI have seen this answer too many times without qualifications. Merely the use of stored procedures does not assist in the mitigation of SQL injection. If not handled properly, dynamic SQL within stored procedures can be just as vulnerable to SQL injection as dynamic SQL within a web page.<\/p>\n<p>When using dynamic SQL within a stored procedure, the application must properly sanitize the user input to eliminate the risk of code injection. If not sanitized, the user could enter malicious SQL that will be executed within the stored procedure.<\/p>\n<p>Black box testing uses SQL injection to compromise the system.<br \/>\n\tConsider the following SQL Server Stored Procedure:<\/p>\n<p>Create procedure user_login @username varchar(20), @passwd varchar(20) As<br \/>\n\tDeclare @sqlstring varchar(250)<br \/>\n\tSet @sqlstring = \u2018<br \/>\n\tSelect 1 from users<br \/>\n\tWhere username = \u2018 + @username + \u2018 and passwd = \u2018 + @passwd<br \/>\n\texec(@sqlstring)<br \/>\n\tGo<\/p>\n<p>User input:<\/p>\n<p>anyusername or 1=1\u2032<br \/>\n\tanypassword<\/p>\n<p>This procedure does not sanitize the input, therefore allowing the return value to show an existing record with these parameters.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: This example may seem unlikely due to the use of dynamic SQL to log in a user, but consider a dynamic reporting query where the user selects the columns to view. The user could insert malicious code into this scenario and compromise the data.<br \/>\n\tConsider the following SQL Server Stored Procedure:<\/p>\n<p>Create procedure get_report @columnamelist varchar(7900) As<br \/>\n\tDeclare @sqlstring varchar(8000)<br \/>\n\tSet @sqlstring = \u2018<br \/>\n\tSelect \u2018 + @columnamelist + \u2018 from ReportTable\u2018<br \/>\n\texec(@sqlstring)<br \/>\n\tGo<\/p>\n<p>User input:<\/p>\n<p>1 from users; update users set password = \u2018password\u2019; select *<\/p>\n<p>This will result in the report running and all users\u2019 passwords being updated.<\/p>\n"

Verification doesn\u2019t affect PageRank or affect your site\u2019s performance in Google\u2019s search results.<\/p>\n<p>To verify that you own a site, you can either add a meta tag to your home page (proving that you have access to the source files), or upload a specific HTML file to your server (proving that you have access to the server). Webmaster Tools will check to see that the file or tag is present.

            "articleBody": "<p>1. Prevent Hotlinking<\/p>\n<p>Hotlinking is when people use your bandwidth by putting the images hosted on your server on their website. Add the following code at the bottom of your .htaccess file to prevent hotlinking.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nOptions +FollowSymlinks\n\n#Protect against hotlinking\n\nRewriteEngine On\n\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$\n\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http:\/\/(www.)?domainname.com\/ [nc]\n\nRewriteRule .*.(gif|jpg|png)$ http:\/\/domainname.com\/img\/stop_stealing_bandwidth.gif[nc]\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>2. Block All Requests From User Agents<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible to block all unwanted user agents that might be potentially harmful or perhaps just to keep the server load as low as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n#Block bad bots\n<div style=\"display:none; visibility:hidden;\" id=\"vcsp\"><\/div>\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-Agent ^FrontPage [NC,OR]\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-Agent ^Java.* [NC,OR]\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-Agent ^Microsoft.URL [NC,OR]\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-Agent ^MSFrontPage [NC,OR]\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-Agent ^Offline.Explorer [NC,OR]\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-Agent ^[Ww]eb[Bb]andit [NC,OR]\n\nSetEnvIfNoCase user-Agent ^Zeus [NC]\n\n&lt;limit get=\u201d\" post=\u201d\" head=\u201d\"&gt;\n\nOrder Allow,Deny\n\nAllow from all\n\nDeny from env=bad_bot\n\n&lt;\/limit&gt;\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>3. Redirect Everyone Except Specified IPs<\/p>\n<p>If for some reason you would want to deny everyone or allow only a specific group of IP addresses to access your website, add the following code to your .htaccess file:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nErrorDocument 403 http:\/\/www.domainname.com\n\nOrder deny,allow\n\nDeny from all\n\nAllow from 124.34.48.165\n\nAllow from 102.54.68.123\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>4. SEO Friendly 301 Redirects<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve transferred domain names or wish to redirect a specific page or pages without getting penalty from search engines such as Google, use the following code:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nRedirect 301 \/d\/file.html http:\/\/www.domainname.com\/r\/file.html\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>5. Creating a Custom Error Page<\/p>\n<p>Now you can easily create your own and refer to it like this:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nErrorDocument 401 \/error\/401.php\n\nErrorDocument 403 \/error\/403.php\n\nErrorDocument 404 \/error\/404.php\n\nErrorDocument 500 \/error\/500.php\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>6. Create an IP Banlist<\/p>\n<p>Tired of getting the same bs comments specific user over and over again? Just ban this by adding the following code to your .htaccess file:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nallow from all\n\ndeny from 145.186.14.122\n\ndeny from 124.15\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>7. Set Default Email Address For Server Admin<\/p>\n<p>Using the following code you can specify the default email address for the server\u2019s admin.<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nServerSignature EMail\n\nSetEnv SERVER_ADMIN default@domain.com\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>8. Disable Display of Download Request<\/p>\n<p>Usually when downloading something from a web site, you\u2019ll be prompted if you wish to open the file or save it on your hard-disk. To prevent the server from prompting users wether they wish to open or save the file and to just save the file, use the following code:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nAddType application\/octet-stream .pdf\n\nAddType application\/octet-stream .zip\n\nAddType application\/octet-stream .mov\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>9. Protect a Specific File<\/p>\n<p>The following code allows you to deny access to any file you wish by throwing an 403 error when it is trying to be accessed. In the following example I\u2019ve chosen to protect the .htaccess file by adding an extra layer of security.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n#Protect the .htaccess File\n\n&lt;files .htaccess=\u201d\"&gt;\n\norder allow,deny\n\ndeny from all\n\n&lt;\/files&gt;\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>10. Compress Components With mod_deflate<\/p>\n<p>As an alternative to compressing files with Gzip, you can use mod_deflate(which is supposively faster). Place the following code at the top of your .htaccess file(tip: you can also add .jpg|.gif|.png|.tiff|.ico mod_deflate those):<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n&lt;ifmodule mod_deflate.c=\u201d\"&gt;\n\n&lt;filesmatch .(js|css)$=\u201d\"&gt;\n\nSetOutputFilter DEFLATE\n\n&lt;\/filesmatch&gt;\n\n&lt;\/ifmodule&gt;\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>11. Add Expires Headers<\/p>\n<p>The following code shows you how to add an expiration date on the headers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n&lt;filesmatch .(ico|pdf|flv|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|swf)$=\u201d\"&gt;\n\nHeader set Expires \u201cWed, 21 May 2010 20:00:00 GMT\u201d\n\n&lt;\/filesmatch&gt;\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>12. Setting the Default Page<\/p>\n<p>You can set the default page of a directory to the page of your choice. For example in this code the default page is set as about.html instead of index.html<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n#Serve Alternate Default Index Page\n\nDirectoryIndex about.html\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>13. Password Protect Your Directories and Files<\/p>\n<p>You can enable password authentication for any directory or file on your server by using the following code:<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n#password-protect a file\n\n&lt;files secure.php=\u201d\"&gt;\n\nAuthType Basic\n\nAuthName \u201cPrompt\u201d\n\nAuthUserFile \/home\/path\/.htpasswd\n\nRequire valid-user\n\n&lt;\/files&gt;<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p># password-protect a directory<br \/>\n\tresides<br \/>\n\tAuthType basic<br \/>\n\tAuthName \u201cThis directory is protected\u201d<br \/>\n\tAuthUserFile \/home\/path\/.htpasswd<br \/>\n\tAuthGroupFile \/dev\/null<br \/>\n\tRequire valid-user<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>14. Redirect an Old Domain to a New Domain<\/p>\n<p>By using the .htaccess file you can redirect a old domain name to a new domain by adding the following code into the htaccess file. Basically what it does is it will remap the old domain to the new one.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n#Redirect from an old domain to a new domain\n\nRewriteEngine On\n\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http:\/\/www.domainname.com\/$1 [R=301,L]\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>15. Force Caching<\/p>\n<p>The following code will not directly increase the loading speed of your website. What it will do is, load the content of your site faster when the same user revisits your website by sending 304 status when requested components have not been modified. You can change the cache expiry by changing the number of seconds(it\u2019s currently set at 1 day).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nFileETag MTime Size\n\nExpiresActive on\n\nExpiresDefault \u201caccess plus 86400 seconds\u201d\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>16. Compress Components By Enabling Gzip<\/p>\n<p>By making use of Gzip you can compress files in order to make your website load faster.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text\/html text\/plain text\/xml application\/xml application\/xhtml+xml text\/javascript text\/css application\/x-javascript\n\nBrowserMatch ^Mozilla\/4 gzip-only-text\/html\n\nBrowserMatch ^Mozilla\/4.0[678] no-gzip<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>BrowserMatch bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text\/html<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>17. Remove \u201ccategory\u201d from a URL<\/p>\n<p>To transform this url: <a href=\"http:\/\/yourdomain.com\/category\/blue\">http:\/\/yourdomain.com\/category\/blue<\/a> to -&gt; <a href=\"http:\/\/yourdomain.com\/blue\">http:\/\/yourdomain.com\/blue<\/a>, just add the following code at the bottom of your .htaccess file.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nRewriteRule ^category\/(.+)$ http:\/\/www.yourdomain.com\/$1 [R=301,L]\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>18. Disable Directory Browsing<\/p>\n<p>To prevent people from accessing any directories that might contain valueble information or reveal security weaknesses(e.g. plugin directories of wordpress), add the following code to your .htacess file:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nOptions All -Indexes\n<div id=\"sxbb\"><a href=\"http:\/\/religionfilm.com\/it\/unpaid-loans\">and throw<\/a><\/div>\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>19. Redirect WordPress Feeds to FeedBurner<\/p>\n<p>The following snippet redirects WordPress\u2019 default RSS feed feedburner\u2019s feed.<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n#Redirect wordpress content feeds to feedburner\n\n&lt;ifmodule mod_rewrite.c=\u201d\"&gt;\n\nRewriteEngine on\n\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !FeedBurner [NC]\n\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !FeedValidator [NC]\n\nRewriteRule ^feed\/?([_0-9a-z-]+)?\/?$ http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/yourfeed [R=302,NC,L]\n\n&lt;\/ifmodule&gt;\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>20. Deny Comments from No Referrer Requests<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that bots just post comments about how to increase your private parts all naturally to your blogs without coming from any other site. It\u2019s like they fall from the sky. This neat hack prevents people from posting if they did not come from somewhere else(they can comment just fine if they came from e.g. google).<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n1 RewriteEngine On\n\n2 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST\n\n3 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .wp-comments-post\\.php*\n\n4 RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !.*yourblog.com.* [OR]\n\n5 RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$\n\n6 RewriteRule (.*) ^http:\/\/%{REMOTE_ADDR}\/$ [R=301,L]\n\n<\/pre><p><\/p>\n<p>21. Remove File Extension From URL<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Kartlos Tchavelachvili for this one. What the following code does is, it removes the .php extension(you can change it to whatever you like e.g. html) in a url. It makes the URL prettier &amp; SEO friendlier.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\nRewriteRule ^(([^\/]+\/)*[^.]+)$ \/$1.php [L]\n\n<\/pre><p><\/p>\n<p>22.

Add Trailing Slash to URL<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Some search engines remove the trailing slash from urls that look like directories \u2013 e.g. Yahoo does it. But \u2013 it could result into duplicated content problems when the same page content is accessible under different urls.

If yes, you might know that XHTML 1.0 Strict don\u2019t allow it. A good solution to this problem should be using JQuery to make links opening in new windows:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$(\u2018a[@rel$='external']\u2018).click(function(){\n\nthis.target = \u201c_blank\u201d;\n\n});\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\/*<br \/>\n\tUsage:<br \/>\n\t&lt;a href=\u201d<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lepinskidesign.com.br\/\u201d\">http:\/\/www.lepinskidesign.com.br\/\u201d<\/a> rel=\u201dexternal\u201d&gt;lepinskidesign.com.br&lt;\/a&gt;<br \/>\n\t*\/<\/p>\n<p>2. Get the total number of matched elements<\/p>\n<p>That what I call a very simple, but very useful tip: This will return the number of matched elements:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n$(\u2018element\u2019).size();\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>3. Preloading images<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re using images in Javascript, a good thing is to preload it before you have to use it. This code will do the job:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\njQuery.preloadImages = function()\n\n{\n\nfor(var i = 0; i\u201d).attr(\u201csrc\u201d, arguments[i]);\n\n}\n\n};\n\n\/\/ Usage\n\n$.preloadImages(\u201cimage1.gif\u201d, \u201c\/path\/to\/image2.png\u201d, \u201csome\/image3.jpg\u201d);\n\n<\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>4. Detect browser<\/p>\n<p>Although it is better to use CSS conditionnal comments to detect a specific browser and apply some css style, it is a very easy thing to do with JQuery, which can be useful at times.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>\n\n\/\/A.

            "articleBody": "<p>This calculation of user capacity for a server has been developed over years of actual applications. The topic has been considered in various forms by others, but this methodology yields insight to the parameters that must be considered. A sample worksheet is included that shows server configuration comparisons. Using such a spreadsheet would allow a designer to compare configurations, which can then be price (budget) compared.<\/p>\n<p>The equation is: Users = (A * B * C * D)\/50<\/p>\n<pre>\nwhere<\/pre><p>A = CPU Percentage Loading to be considered B = CPU Speed in GHz C = Motherboard Frontside Bus Speed in MHz D = Number of CPU Cores (effective core count including multiple cores, hyperthreading, etc.) Denominator of 50 from empirical data for networks running typical data applications<\/p>\n<p>A few factors relative to the equation should be further explained.<\/p>\n<p>1. The equation relates the percentage processor loading to be allowed, the CPU speed in GHz, the Frontside Bus Speed (FBS) in MHz and the number of effective CPU cores, along with an empirical factor derived from many practical server network operating systems and networked applications.<\/p>\n<p>2. The \u201cA\u201d parameter considers the level of loading of the CPU. A typical value is 50% loading, which isn\u2019t too high nor too low and is typical of a network server (Windows Server 2008 Enterprise) with the calculated maximum number of users running typical office data applications.<\/p>\n<p>3. The \u201cB\u201d parameter is the processor (CPU) speed expressed in GHz.<\/p>\n<p>4. The \u201cC\u201d factor is speed of the server motherboard frontside bus expressed in MHz.<\/p>\n<p>5. The \u201cD\u201d factor is the effective number of processor (CPU) cores in the server (consider multiple cores and enhancements like Hyperthreading, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>6. The \u201c50\u201d denominator is empirical for a server in a typical data environment, i.e., not additionally running Citrix, virtualization (VMWare, HyperV), VoIP, SQL Server, Exchange Server, etc. An increase of this factor to a value of 75 to 100 would be recommended in such specialized network. environments depending on the particulars. The result of the increased division factor will decrease the number of users that can be accommodated.<\/p>\n<p>7. The equation was developed in Windows Server 2003 and Server 2008 environments, but mostly Server 2008 Enterprise networks setup and operated in many configurations for IT courses at Miller-Motte College, Wilmington, NC taught by the author over a 4-year period.<\/p>\n<p>The typical server setup assumed a server RAM requirement of 16 MB per concurrent user plus 2 GB for the network operating system (NOS) housekeeping. So once the number of concurrent users is calculated by the sizing equation, the next calculation yields the minimum RAM size required.<\/p>\n<p>The second equation is:<\/p>\n<p>RAM = (Users * 0.016) + 2<\/p>\n<p>where RAM = memory size in GB Users = calculated from first equation 0.016GB = 16MB per concurrent user (can vary depending upon the applications on the network) 2GB = NOS network operation (can vary depending upon the applications on the network) With these calculations, one can size a server for a network application instead of the \u201cblue-sky\u201d, \u201cbuy &amp; try\u201d or \u201cover-specification\u201d methods. The method presented is illustrated in the following worksheet.<\/p>\n<p>Server 2008 Server Capacity Calculation<\/p>\n<p>Users = A * B * C * D \/ 50<\/p>\n<p>Assumes RAM of 16 MB per concurrent user, plus 2 GB for NOS (network operations).<\/p>\n<p>Item(#) A(%) B(GHz) C(MHz) D(#) Concurrent Users(#) RAM(GB)<\/p>\n<p>\n\t1-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1033 1 30 2.5<\/p>\n<p>2-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1033 2 60 3.0<\/p>\n<p>3-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1033 4 120 3.9<\/p>\n<p>4-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1033 8 240 5.8<\/p>\n<p>5-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1033 12 359 7.8<\/p>\n<p>6-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1666 1 48 2.8<\/p>\n<p>7-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1666 2 97 3.5<\/p>\n<p>8-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1666 3 145 4.3<\/p>\n<p>9-&gt; 0.5 2.9 1666 4 193 5.1<\/p>\n<p>10-&gt; 0.5 3.3 1666 8 440 9.0<\/p>\n<p>11-&gt; 0.25 3.3 1666 12 330 7.3<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe presented method can save money, time, and worry in specifying a server for a particular set of users and network applications. It presents a rational method for the sizing of servers and has an empirical factor that can be changed to reflect the personal experience of an individual designer, if desired.<\/p>\n"

There are 3 possible states:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\t<span class=\"simpara\">0 - NORMAL<\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"simpara\">1 - ABORTED<\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"simpara\">2 - TIMEOUT<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>When a PHP script is running normally the NORMAL state, is active. If the remote client disconnects the ABORTED state flag is turned on. A remote client disconnect is usually caused by the user hitting his STOP button. If the PHP-imposed time limit (see\u00a0<span class=\"function\"><a class=\"function\" href=\"http:\/\/us3.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.set-time-limit.php\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153); background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_blank\">set_time_limit()<\/a><\/span>) is hit, the TIMEOUT state flag is turned on.<\/p>\n<p>You can decide whether or not you want a client disconnect to cause your script to be aborted. Sometimes it is handy to always have your scripts run to completion even if there is no remote browser receiving the output. The default behaviour is however for your script to be aborted when the remote client disconnects. This behaviour can be set via the ignore_user_abort\u00a0<var class=\"filename\">php.ini<\/var>\u00a0directive as well as through the corresponding\u00a0<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">php_value ignore_user_abort<\/em>\u00a0Apache\u00a0<var class=\"filename\">httpd.conf<\/var>\u00a0directive or with the\u00a0<span class=\"function\"><a class=\"function\" href=\"http:\/\/us3.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.ignore-user-abort.php\" target=\"_blank\">ignore_user_abort()<\/a><\/span>\u00a0function. If you do not tell PHP to ignore a user abort and the user aborts, your script will terminate. The one exception is if you have registered a shutdown function using\u00a0<span class=\"function\"><a class=\"function\" href=\"http:\/\/us3.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.register-shutdown-function.php\" target=\"_blank\">register_shutdown_function()<\/a><\/span>. With a shutdown function, when the remote user hits his STOP button, the next time your script tries to output something PHP will detect that the connection has been aborted and the shutdown function is called. This shutdown function will also get called at the end of your script terminating normally, so to do something different in case of a client disconnect you can use the\u00a0<span class=\"function\"><a class=\"function\" href=\"http:\/\/us3.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.connection-aborted.php\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153); background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_blank\">connection_aborted()<\/a><\/span>\u00a0function. This function will return\u00a0<strong><code style=\"font-family: Consolas, 'Andale Mono WT', 'Andale Mono', 'Lucida Console', Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\">TRUE<\/code><\/strong>\u00a0if the connection was aborted.<\/p>\n<p>Your script can also be terminated by the built-in script timer. The default timeout is 30 seconds. It can be changed using the<strong class=\"option unknown\">max_execution_time<\/strong>\u00a0<var class=\"filename\">php.ini<\/var>\u00a0directive or the corresponding\u00a0<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">php_value max_execution_time<\/em>\u00a0Apache\u00a0<var class=\"filename\">httpd.conf<\/var>\u00a0directive as well as with the\u00a0<span class=\"function\"><a class=\"function\" href=\"http:\/\/us3.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.set-time-limit.php\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153); background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_blank\">set_time_limit()<\/a><\/span>\u00a0function. When the timer expires the script will be aborted and as with the above client disconnect case, if a shutdown function has been registered it will be called. Within this shutdown function you can check to see if a timeout caused the shutdown function to be called by calling the\u00a0<span class=\"function\"><a class=\"function\" href=\"http:\/\/us3.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.connection-status.php\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153); background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_blank\">connection_status()<\/a><\/span>\u00a0function. This function will return 2 if a timeout caused the shutdown function to be called.<\/p>\n<p>One thing to note is that both the ABORTED and the TIMEOUT states can be active at the same time. This is possible if you tell PHP to ignore user aborts. PHP will still note the fact that a user may have broken the connection, but the script will keep running. If it then hits the time limit it will be aborted and your shutdown function, if any, will be called. At this point you will find that\u00a0<span class=\"function\"><a class=\"function\" href=\"http:\/\/us3.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.connection-status.php\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 153); background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_blank\">connection_status()<\/a><\/span>\u00a0returns 3.<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>If you are running more than one Drupal site, you can simplify management and upgrading of your sites by using the multi-site feature. Multi-site allows you to share a single Drupal installation (including core code, contributed modules, and themes) among several sites.<\/p>\n<p>\tThis is particularly useful for managing the code since each upgrade only needs to be done once. Each site will have its own database and its own configuration settings, so each site will have its own content, settings, enabled modules, and enabled theme. However, the sites are sharing a code base and web document root, so there may be security concerns (see section below for more information).<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Overview of the Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\tTo create a new site using a shared Drupal code base you must complete the following steps:<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create a new database for the site.<br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create a new subdirectory of the 'sites' directory with the name of your new site (see below for information on how to name the subdirectory).<br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Copy the file into the subdirectory you created in the previous step. Rename the new file to .<br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adjust the permissions of the new site directory, and grant write permissions on the configuration file<br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Make symbolic links if you are using a subdirectory such as example.com\/subdir and not a subdomain such as subd.example.com (see the subdirectory multi-site section below for details).<br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a Web browser, navigate to the URL of the new site and continue with the standard Drupal installation procedure.<\/p>\n<p>\tIt may also be necessary to modify your Web server's configuration file (often named for Apache) to allow Drupal to override Apache's settings. This is true for all installations of Drupal and is not specific to the multi-site install. Additional information is available in the Best Practices: Configuring Apache and PHP for Drupal in a Shared Environment section of the Install Guide.<br \/>\n\tDetails of the Process<br \/>\n\tDomains, URLs, and sites subdirectory name<\/p>\n<p>\tThe new subdirectory of the sites directory has a name that is constructed from the site's URL. For example, the configuration for would be in . You do not need to include 'www' as part of the directory name.<\/p>\n<p>\tDrupal will use the same directory for any subdomain of , including www, unless there is an alternative, matching subdomain sites subdirectory. For instance, URL would be served from , if it exists.<\/p>\n<p>\tFor a subdirectory URL, such as , name the sites subdirectory as follows: -- and read the section below on getting subdirectory multi-site working.<\/p>\n<p>\tIf you are installing on a non-standard port, the port number is treated as the first part of the subdomain. For example, could be loaded from . If that directory doesn't exist, Drupal would then look for , just like a real subdomain.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Site-specific modules and themes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\tEach site configuration can have its own site-specific modules and themes in addition to those installed in the standard 'modules' and 'themes' directories. To use site-specific modules or themes, simply create a 'modules' or 'themes' directory within the site configuration directory. For example, if sub.example.com has a custom theme and a custom module that should not be accessible to other sites, the setup would look like this:<\/p>\n<p>\tsites\/sub.example.com\/settings.php<br \/>\n\tsites\/sub.example.com\/themes\/custom_theme<br \/>\n\tsites\/sub.example.com\/modules\/custom_module<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Document root<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\tOne area of frequent confusion is that in a Drupal multisite installation the webserver document root is the same for all sites. For example with the following three sites: example.com, sub.example.com and example.com\/site3 there will be a single Drupal directory and all sites will be calling the same index.php file.<\/p>\n<p>\tSome webhosts automatically create a new directory (i.e. example.com) when creating a new domain or subdomain. In this case it is necessary to make it into a symbolic link to the main Drupal directory, or better yet when creating the domain or subdomain, set it to use the same document root as the site where you have Drupal installed.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Subdirectory multi-site<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\tIf you are attempting to get Drupal multi-site working using subdirectory URLs rather than subdomain or different domain URLs, you may encounter problems. You'll start out by making a directory such as , and putting a settings.php file there. If this works for you, great! But it probably will not, until you make a symbolic link that tells your web server that the document root for is the same as the document root for . To do this, go to the example.com document root and type:<\/p>\n<p>\t(substituting the actual name of the subdirectory you want to make work).<\/p>\n<p>\tIf your codebase itself is in a subdirectory, then link your new site to the directory:<\/p>\n<p>\tThis symbolic link is enough to resolve issues with subdirectory multi-site installations on at least some web hosts. But if you still encounter problems, such as issues getting clean URLs to work (especially if you had to edit the .htaccess file to get clean URLs working on the main example.com domain site), you may find this forum suggestion useful:<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/239583#comment-786932\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/239583#comment-786932<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\tNote that these problems do not usually occur for multi-site installations using a subdomain, so you might want to try that if you cannot get subdirectory multi-site to work. (However, subdomains are not good for search engine rankings!)<br \/>\n\tLocalhost alias for local workstation<\/p>\n<p>\tOn many systems it is possible to create entries in a \"hosts\" file to create aliases for the localhost name for a local workstation. By creating aliases for localhost it is possible to create names such as localdev1.example.com and localdev2.example.com, both for the local computer.<\/p>\n<p>\tIf on the other hand you use subdirectories in your local web root, create a symbolic link like this:<\/p>\n<p>\tand name your site folder localhost.subdir.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Domain name changes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\tOnce a site is in production in a particular subdirectory under the sites directory, the subdirectory should not be renamed, even if the Web site URL changes. This is because several database tables (for example: system and files) include references to \"sites\/<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mydomain.com.&quot;\">www.mydomain.com.\"<\/a> Instead of renaming the sites directory, you can create a symlink to the new URL from the old one. Navigate to the sites directory and then use the following command:<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Security Concerns<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\tYou might want to reconsider using Drupal's multi-site configuration, in situations where the administrators for all of the sites being run from the same code base are not either the same person or a small group with a high level of mutual trust. The reason is that anyone with full administrative privileges on a Drupal site can execute arbitrary PHP code on that site through various means (even without FTP access to the site), and that arbitrary PHP code could be used from one site to affect another site, if the two sites are in the same HTTP document root and sharing the same Drupal code.<\/p>\n<p>\tSo, unless you completely trust all of the administrators of the sites you are considering running from the same Drupal code base to be knowledgeable, careful, and not malicious, you might want to consider installing their Drupal sites in completely separate areas of the web server that are not able to affect each other via PHP scripting.<br \/>\n\t\u00a0<\/p>\n"

To maintain quality of the product continuous regression tests need to be executed to ensure predictive behavior of the product with each release. Generally companies are maintaining a set of manual test cases and run them with each product releases. With each product release new features are added and hence these test scripts are updated with new test cases and hence they becomes huge. Time of execute these huge test scripts with each product release would put adherence to the release timelines which would significantly impact time of market of the product. Hence a need arises to automate these repetitive test cycles to reduce this time and increase time to market. A good open source tool Selenium will help in automating this repetitive task. Following are advantages of using selenium over other available tools in the market.<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tLow cost open source tool: Selenium is offered as free open source test automation framework and tools to automate testing of web application developed in any language.

While its obvious leaders are human and will always make mistakes, leadership behavior will <em>always <\/em>have a direct impact on the well-being and satisfaction of the people they are privileged to lead. It\u2019s been said people don\u2019t leave organizations, they leave managers and in most cases, I believe this to be true.<\/p>\n<p>Looking back, I have found the times when my leadership has suffered it can be traced back to selfishness. In my mind, I would be asking things like \u201cWhy can\u2019t this person be more like me? That\u2019s not how I would do it.\u201d or \u201cHow will this mistake someone on my team made reflect on me?\u201d The physical response to these questions would typically result in over-reactions and micro-management.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, I have come to the realization that being a respected, yet selfless leader comes down to <em>saying<\/em> and <em>meaning<\/em> two simple phrases that are spoken to your people as frequently as possible. Provide vision, direction, encouragement, and support for your team and then do everything you can to overuse these words:<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cI trust you\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\n\tI trust you completely without a single doubt in my mind of your abilities.<br \/>\n\tI trust that you will ask for help if you need it but otherwise, go out and do amazing things.<br \/>\n\tI trust\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\n\tI\u2019m proud of the work you create everyday.<br \/>\n\tI\u2019m proud of the unique ideas you bring.<br \/>\n\tI\u2019m proud that you tried something out of your comfort zone and \u201cfailed.\u201d<br \/>\n\tI\u2019m proud\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I know I\u2019m getting close to overuse when someone will reply with \u201cI know you trust me!\u201d or \u201cI know you\u2019re proud of me!\u201d but I keep saying it anyway\u2026<\/p>\n<p>What if you\u2019re having a tough time saying these words to someone on your team?

At the first tinge of doubt that may infringe on my trust in them, I use it as an internal trigger. Not a trigger to figure out what is wrong with him, or start judging them, or start a development plan for her. Rather, I start with what am I NOT doing:<\/p>\n<p>Have I spent enough time teaching, mentoring, or coaching them?<br \/>\n\tHave I given them every thing they need to do amazing things?<br \/>\n\tAm I adapting my leadership approach based on their personality and learning traits (and not mine)?<br \/>\n\tHave I spent enough time with them to find out a little about their life outside of work?<br \/>\n\tWhen was the last time I recognized or praised them?<br \/>\n\tWhen was the last time I wrote a hand-written note of appreciation for them choosing to work here?<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>In every codebase, there are the dark corners and alleys you fear. Code that\u2019s impossibly brittle; code that bites back with regression bugs; code that when you attempt to follow, will drive you mad.<\/p>\n<p>Ward Cunningham created a beautiful metaphor for the hard-to-change, error-prone parts of code when he likened it to financial debt. Technical debt prevents you from moving forward, from profiting, from staying \u201cin the black.\u201d As in the real world, there\u2019s cheap debt, debt with an interest lower than you can make in a low-risk financial instrument. Then there\u2019s the expensive stuff, the high-interest credit card fees that pile on even more debt.<\/p>\n<p>Technical debt is a drag. It can kill productivity, making maintenance annoying, difficult, or, in some cases, impossible. Beyond the obvious economic downside, there\u2019s a real psychological cost to technical debt. No developer enjoys sitting down to his computer in the morning knowing he\u2019s about to face impossibly brittle, complicated source code. The frustration and helplessness thus engendered is often a root cause of more systemic problems, such as developer turnover\u2014 just one of the real economic costs of technical debt.<\/p>\n<p>Every codebase I\u2019ve worked on or reviewed contains some measure of technical debt. One class of debt is fairly harmless: byzantine dependencies among bizarrely named types in stable, rarely modified recesses of your system. Another is sloppy code that is easily fixed on the spot, but often ignored in the rush to address higher-priority problems. There are many more examples.<\/p>\n<p>This article outlines a workflow and several tactics for dealing with the high-interest debt. The processes and practices I\u2019ll detail aren\u2019t new. They are taken straight from the Lean\/Agile playbook.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Case for Fixing Debt<\/h2>\n<p>The question, \u201cshould we fix technical debt,\u201d is a no-brainer in my book. Of course you should. Technical debt works against your goals because it slows you down over time. There\u2019s a well-known visualization called the cost of change curve (see <strong>Figure 1<\/strong>), that illustrates the difference between the 100-percent-quality-test-driven approach and the cowboy-coder-hacking-with-duct-tape approach.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cost of Change Curve\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/i.msdn.microsoft.com\/ee819135.Laribee_Figure1%28en-us,MSDN.10%29.jpg\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Figure 1 <strong>Cost of Change Curve<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The cost of change curve illustrates that high quality, simple, and easy to follow designs may cost more initially, but incur less technical debt\u2014subsequent additions and modifications to the code are less costly over time. In the quality curve (blue), you can see the initial cost is higher, but it\u2019s predictable over time. The hack-it curve (red) gets a lower cost of entry, but future development, maintenance, and the total cost of owning a product and its code becomes ever more expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Ward Cunningham\u2019s First Law of Programming\u201d (<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi-bin\/wiki?FirstLawOfProgramming\" id=\"ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl02\">c2.com\/cgi-bin\/wiki?FirstLawOfProgramming<\/a>) states, \u201clowering quality lengthens development time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cQuality software takes the least amount of time to develop. If you have code that is simple as possible, tests that are complete and a design that fits just right, additions and changes happen in the fastest possible way because the impact is lowest. Consequently, if you hack something out, the more you hack the slower you go because the cost of addition or change grows with each line of code.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, technical debt will decrease the throughput of your team over time.<\/p>\n<p>One of my great joys in software development is relishing the feeling of raw productivity. The competing and converse feeling, for me at least, is pain. It\u2019s painful when I\u2019m not productive and it\u2019s pain that robs me of potential productivity, the so-called \u201cgood days at work.\u201d There are many sources of pain in software development, but none more obvious than a rigid and chaotic codebase. This psychological effect takes a toll on team morale which, in turn, causes productivity to lag.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tSystems Thinking<\/h2>\n<p>In order to fix technical debt, you need to cultivate buy-in from stakeholders and teammates alike. To do this, you need to start thinking systemically. Systems thinking is long-range thinking. It is investment thinking. It\u2019s the idea that effort you put in today will let you progress at a predictable and sustained pace in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s easiest to explain systems thinking with an analogy. I live in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, in a quaint little neighborhood called Inman Park. I\u2019m mostly very happy there. I reserve, however, some irritation related to the seemingly complete ignorance of urban planning. The streets in Atlanta are byzantine, maze-like, madness-provoking. When you miss your turn, you can\u2019t simply loop back. If you do, you\u2019ll be sent on a spiraling path to who-knows-where. There seems to be little rhyme or reason to the planning of roads in this otherwise very pleasant corner of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Contrast this with the orderly streets and avenues of Manhattan in New York City (most of it, anyway). It\u2019s as if a Marine Corps drill instructor designed the city. Avenues stretch the length of the island, north to south, and streets form tidy, latitudinal markers down its length. Furthermore, both streets and avenues are named in numerical sequence: First Avenue, Second Avenue, 42nd Street, 43rd Street, and so on. You\u2019ll rarely walk more than a block in the wrong direction.<\/p>\n<p>What are the root causes for the difference between Atlanta and New York City in this dimension of comparison?<\/p>\n<p>In Atlanta the streets were formed by cattle wearing down paths. You heard me right, <em>cattle paths<\/em>. Some need arose to frequently move between the urban center and the suburbs, at which point some cowboy thought, \u201cgolly, wouldn\u2019t it be easiest to turn these here cattle paths into roads?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The New York State Legislature applied vision and forethought to the design of the ever-growing and largest city in the state. They chose the gridiron plan, with orderly, predictable streets and avenues. They were thinking of the future.<\/p>\n<p>This story gets to the essence of systems thinking. While legislative processes are slow, investment in time and commitment to vision pays the greatest dividend for the <em>lifetime of a system<\/em>. True you\u2019ll have to deal with crazy cabs on the mean streets of Manhattan, but you\u2019ll be able to find your way around in a matter of days. In Atlanta, it\u2019s been a year of getting lost, and I thank the system thinkers responsible for the Global Positioning System (GPS) each and every day.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tProducts over Projects<\/h2>\n<p>The idea that you have a development team that completes a project then throws it over the wall to a maintenance team is fundamentally flawed. Make no mistakes, you are working on a product, and if it succeeds, it\u2019s going to live a long, long time.<\/p>\n<p>If you have even a couple of years of experience as a professional developer, you\u2019ve probably experienced the increasing gravity effect. You develop a piece of software that isn\u2019t meant to last or be complicated or change. And six months later, what are you doing? Modifying it? Extending it? Fixing bugs?<\/p>\n<p>Useful software has a sometimes nasty habit of sticking around for a very long time. It\u2019s up to you to pick the metaphor you want to roll with. Will you tend a forest of beautiful California Redwoods, living entities enduring the centuries and reaching the highest heights, or will you allow the relentless Kudzu vine to starve your forest of light?<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tBasic Workflow<\/h2>\n<p>At this point, I hope I\u2019ve convinced you that technical debt can take an awful toll on both your mental health and your customer\u2019s bottom line. I hope, also, that you accept the need to take a longer-range view on the products you\u2019re creating.<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s figure out how you can dig yourself out of this hole.<\/p>\n<p>No matter the shop, my sense is that the basic workflow for tackling technical debt\u2014indeed any kind of improvement\u2014is repeatable. Essentially, you want to do four things:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tIdentify where you have debt. How much is each debt item affecting your company\u2019s bottom line and team\u2019s productivity?<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tBuild a business case and forge a consensus on priority with those affected by the debt, both team and stakeholders.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tFix the debt you\u2019ve chosen head on with proven tactics.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tRepeat. Go back to step 1 to identify additional debt and hold the line on the improvements you\u2019ve made.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>It\u2019s worth mentioning, for the software process nerds out there, that this workflow is adapted from a business management approach called the Theory of Constraints (ToC) created by Eliyahu Goldratt (<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/goldrattconsulting.com\/\" id=\"ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl03\">goldrattconsulting.com<\/a>). ToC is a systems-thinking model that provides a framework for improving the overall throughput of the system. This is a gross simplification, but ToC is predicated on the idea that a system (a manufacturing facility, for example) is only as productive as its biggest bottleneck. Value, such as a feature request or automobile or any sellable item, is conceived of, designed, produced, and deployed. A feature may be requested by a customer, internal or external, and that feature flows through your business (the system), transforming from an idea to a tangible result. What happens when these features pile up in front of your quality assurance team? What happens when there\u2019s more demand for development than a development team can fulfill? You get a bottleneck and the whole system slows down.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s very likely that you have many areas of debt\u2014many bottlenecks\u2014in your codebase. Finding the debt that slows you down the most will have the greatest net effect on increasing your throughput. Understanding, then tackling debt and resulting improvements as a team\u2014as a system\u2014is the most effective way to make positive change, because more eyes and hands on the code equates to less risk and better designs.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tIdentify Areas of Debt<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important that you be able to point at the problem areas. If you haven\u2019t been keeping track of them on a wiki or a shared list or in code comments, your first task is to find the debt.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re working on a team, I suggest calling a meeting to develop a concrete list of the top areas of debt in your code. An exhaustive list isn\u2019t important. Focus on capturing the big-ticket items. This meeting is your first opportunity, as a leader on your team, to start forging consensus. A more-than-simple majority of members should agree and understand an item for it to make the list.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have the list, make it durable. Create a wiki topic, write it on a whiteboard (with \u201cDO NOT ERASE\u201d written prominently in one corner), or whatever works in your situation. The medium you choose should be visible, permanent and easy to use. It should be in your face on a regular basis. You need to return to this list and groom it. Human beings have a limited amount of short-term memory, so I suggest keeping a list of between five and nine of the most bothersome items. Don\u2019t worry so much about keeping an inventory\u2014important items will surface again if they\u2019re really, well, important.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tUsing Metrics to Find Trouble Areas<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s hard to find debt, especially if a team is new to a codebase. In cases where there\u2019s no collective memory or oral tradition to draw on, you can use a static analysis tool such as NDepend (<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/ndepend.com\/\" id=\"ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl04\">ndepend.com<\/a>) to probe the code for the more troublesome spots.<\/p>\n<p>Tools are, at best, assistive or perhaps even a second choice. Tools won\u2019t tell you what to do. They will, however, give you inputs to decision-making. There is no single metric for code debt, but people who work on a product day in and day out can surely point to those dark corners that cause the most pain. Static analysis tools will tell you where you have implementation debt. Sadly, they will not tell you where you have debt due to factors like poor naming, discoverability, performance, and other more qualitative design and architectural considerations.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing your test coverage (if you have tests) can be another valuable tool for discovering hidden debt. Clearly, if there\u2019s a big part of your system that lacks solid test coverage, how can you be certain that a change won\u2019t have dramatic effects on the quality of your next release? Regression bugs are likely to appear, creating bottlenecks for QA and potential embarrassment and loss of revenue due to customer-found defects.<\/p>\n<p>Use the log feature of your version control system to generate a report of changes over the last month or two. Find the parts of your system that receive the most activity, changes or additions, and scrutinize them for technical debt. This will help you find the bottlenecks that are challenging you today; there\u2019s very little value in fixing debt in those parts of your system that change rarely.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tHuman Bottlenecks<\/h2>\n<p>You might have a bottleneck if there\u2019s only one developer capable of dealing with a component, subsystem, or whole application. Individual code ownership and knowledge silos (where \u201cDave works on the Accounts Receivables module\u201d\u2014now there\u2019s a painful memory), can block delivery if that person leaves the team or has a pile of other work to do. Finding places in your project where individual ownership is happening lets you consider the benefits and scope of improving the design so other individuals can share the load. Eliminate the bottleneck.<\/p>\n<p>There are tremendous benefits that derive from the eXtreme Programming practice of collective ownership (<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/extremeprogramming.org\/rules\/collective.html\" id=\"ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl05\">extremeprogramming.org\/rules\/collective.html<\/a>). With collective ownership, any developer on your team is allowed to change any code in your codebase \u201cto add functionality, fix bugs, improve designs or refactor. No one person becomes a bottleneck for changes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ah! There\u2019s that word again, \u201cbottleneck.\u201d By enabling collective ownership, you eliminate the dark parts of your system that only a single programmer\u2014who may walk off the job or get hit by a bus\u2014knows about. There is less risk with a codebase that\u2019s collectively owned.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, the design is also much better. Two, three, or four heads are almost certainly better than one. In a collectively owned codebase, a team design ethos emerges and supplants individual idiosyncrasies and quirks.<\/p>\n<p>I call collective code ownership a practice, but collective ownership is really an emergent property of a well-functioning team. Think about it\u2014how many of you show up and work on \u201cyour code\u201d versus code shared by an entire team? What are often called teams in software development are really workgroups with an assignment editor where programming tasks are doled out based on who\u2019s worked on a particular feature, subsystem or \u2028module in the past.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tPrioritize as a Team<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve said before that it\u2019s important you involve the whole team in efforts to improve. As an Agile Coach, I hold closely to the mantra that <em>people support a world they help to create<\/em>. If you don\u2019t have a critical mass of support, an effort to foster a culture of continuous improvement can be very difficult to get off the ground, much less sustain.<\/p>\n<p>Obtaining consensus is key. You want the majority of team members to support the current improvement initiative you\u2019ve selected. I\u2019ve used with some success Luke Hohmann\u2019s \u201cBuy a Feature\u201d approach from his book <em>Innovation Games<\/em> (<a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/innovationgames.com\/\" id=\"ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl06\">innovationgames.com<\/a>). I\u2019ll attempt a gross over-simplification of the game, and urge you to check out the book if it seems like something that\u2019ll work in your environment.<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tGenerate a short list (5-9 items) of things you want to improve. Ideally these items are in your short-term path.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tQualify the items in terms of difficulty. I like to use the abstract notion of a T-shirt size: small, medium, large or extra-large (see the Estimating Improvement Opportunities sidebar for more information on this practice).<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tGive your features a price based on their size. For example, small items may cost $50, medium items $100, and so on.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tGive everyone a certain amount of money. The key here is to introduce scarcity into the game. You want people to have to pool their money to buy the features they\u2019re interested in. You want to price, say, medium features at a cost where no one individual can buy them. It\u2019s valuable to find where more than a single individual sees the priority since you\u2019re trying to build consensus.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tRun a short game, perhaps 20 or 30 minutes in length, where people can discuss, collude, and pitch their case. This can be quite chaotic and also quite fun, and you\u2019ll see where the seats of influence are in your team.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tReview the items that were bought and by what margins they were bought. You can choose to rank your list by the purchased features or, better yet, use the results of the Buy a Feature game in combination with other techniques, such as an awareness of the next release plan.<\/li>\n<\/ol><div>\n<h3>\n\t\tEstimating Improvement Opportunities<\/h3>\n<p>I mentioned estimating debt items or improvement opportunities roughly in terms of T-shirt sizes. This is a common technique used in Agile development methodologies. The idea is that you\u2019re collecting things in terms of relative size. The smalls go together as do the mediums, larges, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not super-important that you bring a lot of accuracy to the table here. Remember: these are relative measures and not commitments. You want to get a rough idea of the difficulty, and the theory is that after estimating a number of items, things will start to even out. Even though one medium item actually takes a pair of developers two weeks to complete while another takes a month, on average a medium will take about three weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, however, you\u2019ll start to gather good examples of what a large or small item really is, and this will aid you in future estimates because you\u2019ll have a basis of comparison. I\u2019ve used several examples of the various sizes in the past as an aid for estimating a new batch of work to good effect.<\/p>\n<p>This can be a tough pill to swallow for management. They\u2019ll initially want to know exactly how long a thing might take and, truth be told, you might need to invest more time in a precise, time-based estimate.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>\n\tSell the Plan<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve got a plan, it\u2019s time to communicate the value of eliminating debt to your project sponsors. In reality, this step can happen in parallel with identification. Involve your customer from the very beginning. After all, development of the plan is going to take time, effort, and (ultimately) money. You want to avoid, at all costs, questions about whose time and dime you spent developing a cohesive plan.<\/p>\n<p>Any successful and sustained effort to remove a large amount of debt absolutely requires the support of your project\u2019s financiers and sponsors. The folks who write the checks need to understand the investment you\u2019re making. This can be a challenge; you\u2019re asking people to think in long range, into the future, and to move away from the buy now, pay later mentality. The explanation \u201cjust because\u201d simply doesn\u2019t cut it.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is that executives will inevitably ask, \u201cAren\u2019t you professionals?\u201d You might feel put against the ropes when probed along these lines. After all, weren\u2019t they paying you, the pro, to deliver a quality product on time and in budget?<\/p>\n<p>This is a tough argument to counter. I say don\u2019t bother. Have the courage and honesty to present the facts as they are. This seemingly risky approach boils down to the very human issues of accountability and trust.<\/p>\n<p>Couch your argument like this: you\u2019ve fielded successful software in the requested amount of time for a provisioned amount of money. In order to achieve this you\u2019ve had to make compromises along the way in response to business pressures. Now, to go forward at a predictable and steady rate, you need to deal with the effects of these compromises. The entire organization has bought them, and now it\u2019s time to pay back.<\/p>\n<p>Your next challenge is to prove to non-technical folks where the debt is causing the most damage. In my experience, business executives respond to quantitative, data-driven arguments supported by \u201cnumbers\u201d and \u201cfacts.\u201d I put numbers and facts in quotes because we all really know we\u2019re living in a relative world and no single number (cyclomatic complexity, efferent coupling, lines of code, test coverage, what have you) sells a change. Compounding this difficulty, you\u2019ll need to communicate the areas of biggest drain in economic terms: why is this slower than you\u2019d like; why did this feature cost so much?<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tEvidence DEFEATS Doubt<\/h2>\n<p>When building your case, there\u2019s an immensely useful tool from the Dale Carnegie management training system embodied in a pithy phrase, \u201cevidence defeats doubt.\u201d As is common with such management systems (and our discipline in general), the DEFEATS part is an acronym. I\u2019ll detail some of the ways in which this applies to software development. Note, however, that I\u2019ve omitted the second E which stands for Exhibit because it seems to repeat the first E, which stands for Example.<\/p>\n<p>D is for <em>Demonstration<\/em>. There\u2019s nothing better than show and tell and this is what the demonstration is all about. If you\u2019re tracking your velocity, this should be easy. Show the dip over time (see <strong>Figure 2<\/strong>) while drawing the connection to increasingly inflexible and hard-to-change code. Once you sell, you need to keep selling.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Tracking Development Velocity\" data-mce-=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/i.msdn.microsoft.com\/ee819135.Laribee_Figure2%28en-us,MSDN.10%29.jpg\" title=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Figure 2 <strong>Tracking Development Velocity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using an Agile process such as Scrum or eXtreme Programming, customer feedback events are an essential practice. At the end of an iteration, demonstrate new features to your customer. While the quality and quantity of features will dip when you encounter the technical debt tar pits and while you ramp up your improvement efforts, you should be able to demonstrate gains over time. Less debt means greater output and greater output yields more stuff to demonstrate.<\/p>\n<p>As the idiom goes, before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes. If you have a more-technical manager, encourage her to work with developers on some of the more difficult sections of the codebase to develop empathy for the difficulty of change. Ask her to look at some code. Can she follow it? Is it readable? There\u2019s no quicker way to win your champion.<\/p>\n<p>E is for <em>Example<\/em>. There\u2019s nothing like a concrete example. Find some stories or requirements that were either impossible to complete because of technical debt, or created significant regression. Pick a section of code that\u2019s unreadable, byzantine, riddled with side-effects. Explain how these attributes of the code led to a customer-found defect or the need for massive effort from QA.<\/p>\n<p>Another powerful tool the Agile processes give you is the retrospective. Choose a story that went south in the last couple of iterations and ask the question \u201cwhy?\u201d Get to the root cause of why this particular story couldn\u2019t be completed, took twice as long as your average story, or spanned more than a single iteration. Often, inflexible software will be the culprit or perhaps you had to revert changes because regression bugs were insurmountable. If you find the last \u201cwhy\u201d ends up being a technical debt-related reason, capture the analysis in a short, direct form. It\u2019s another feather in your cap, another point in your argument.<\/p>\n<p>F is for <em>Fact<\/em>. Facts are very easy to come by. Did you release a project on time? What was the post-release defect rate? What is the team\u2019s average velocity over time? Were customers satisfied with the software as delivered? These are the kind of facts you\u2019ll want to bring to the business table, and I believe it\u2019s these facts that speak most directly to business-minded.<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration is a key element here. As a developer, you can more readily supply technical facts. Look for assistance from the people that own the budgets. Chances are they\u2019ll have a much clearer picture and easier access to the business facts that demonstrate the damage that technical debt is causing.<\/p>\n<p>A is for <em>Analogy<\/em>. I find this especially important. Business people sometimes find software development confusing, even esoteric. If you go to your sponsors with talk of coupling and cohesion and Single Responsibility Principle, you stand a very good chance of losing them. But these are very important concepts in professional software development and, ultimately, it\u2019s how you\u2019re building a data-driven case for tackling debt. My suggestion is to avoid jargon and explain these items with an analogy.<\/p>\n<p>You could describe coupling as a house of cards, for example. Tell your sponsors that the reason your velocity has dropped is because making change to the code is like adding a wall, ceiling, or story to an already established and very elaborate house of cards: a surgical operation requiring an unusually steady hand, significant time and patience, and is ultimately an uncertain and anxiety-provoking event. Sometimes the house of cards collapses.<\/p>\n<p>When employing metaphor and simile, it\u2019s a good idea to state you are doing so. Justify your analogy with a brief description of the more-technical concept you are trying to convey. Using the house of cards example, you might say, \u201cthis is the effect that coupling has on our ability to respond to change and add new features.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>T is for <em>Testimonial<\/em>. Sometimes hearing the same message from a third party can have a more powerful effect. This third party may be an industry leader or a consultant. The reason their word might go farther than yours is that they\u2019re perceived as an objective expert.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have the money to hire an outside consultant, consider collecting anecdotes and insight freely available from industry thought leaders. While generic testimonials about so-called best practices are unlikely to seal the deal, they will add to the gestalt of your overall argument.<\/p>\n<p>S is for <em>Statistics<\/em>. Numbers matter. There\u2019s a common phrase in management, \u201cif you can\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t manage it.\u201d I\u2019m not sure this conventional wisdom applies wholly, but you can certainly present a case. Coupling and complexity are two metrics that can be used to show a root-cause relationship between a declining throughput (how much work is being delivered) and a codebase increasingly calcified with debt.<\/p>\n<p>I find that composite statistics are usually the best bet here; it\u2019s much easier to understand the importance of code coverage if you can overlay a code coverage metric that decreases over time with a decrease in velocity, thus implying, if not showing, a relationship.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tAppoint a Leader<\/h2>\n<p>Your efforts to procure a green light for fixing technical debt will go a lot longer with an effective leader, a champion who can communicate in business terms and who has influence with the decision makers in your organization. Often, this will be your manager, her director, the CTO, the VP of Engineering, or someone in a similar position of perceived authority.<\/p>\n<p>This brings up an interesting chicken and egg problem. How do you sell this person? The process of \u201cmanaging up\u201d is a developer\u2019s responsibility, too. Your first challenge is to sell the seller. How exactly do you do that? Evidence defeats doubt!<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tNext Steps<\/h2>\n<p>So far I\u2019ve covered identifying debt as a team and building a case for fixing that debt. I\u2019ll reiterate: consensus among your team and buy-in with your customers are key factors in these steps.<\/p>\n<p>Make the steps small and don\u2019t invest a lot of time. The first time you identify debt, it will necessarily take longer than when you iterate over new opportunities for improvement, but when you build your case for management, only include those items you plan to work on. Keeping an eye on productivity can be a huge energy saver.<\/p>\n<p>In a future issue I\u2019ll look at the rest of the workflow, including tactics for eliminating debt, and I\u2019ll cover how you can make this process iterative, and capturing the lessons learned from previous debt removal efforts.<\/p>\n"

It\u2019s usually pretty straightforward for developers and webmasters to implement these suggestions by updating their web server configuration, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and images. But we thought we could make it even easier -- ideally these optimizations should happen with minimal developer and webmaster effort.<\/p>\n<p>So today, we\u2019re introducing a module for the Apache HTTP Server called <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/speed\/page-speed\/docs\/module.html\">mod_pagespeed<\/a> to perform many speed optimizations automatically. We\u2019re starting with more than 15 on-the-fly optimizations that address various aspects of web performance, including optimizing caching, minimizing client-server round trips and minimizing payload size. We\u2019ve seen mod_pagespeed reduce page load times by up to 50% (an average across a rough sample of sites we tried) -- in other words, essentially speeding up websites by about 2x, and sometimes even faster.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few simple optimizations that are a pain to do manually, but that mod_pagespeed excels at:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tMaking changes to the pages built by the Content Management Systems (CMS) with no need to make changes to the CMS itself,<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tRecompressing an image when its HTML context changes to serve only the bytes required (typically tedious to optimize manually), and<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tExtending the cache lifetime of the logo and images of your website to a year, while still allowing you to update these at any time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

There are four steps:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tCategorize the site with the taxonomy module<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tCreate user roles<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSet role access control with the taxonomy_access module<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tAssign users to the newly-created roles<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>The rest of this tutorial will use as an example a company website that will have areas for two departments: accounting and public relations. The goal is to restrict editing of each department's area to members of that department.<\/p>\n<div id=\"sbap\"><a href=\"http:\/\/35millionsderegards.com\/easy-pay-day-cash\">Good Financial<\/a><\/div>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Taxonomy<\/strong><br \/>\n\tFirst, make sure the taxonomy module is enabled. Go to <em>administer &gt; content management &gt; categories &gt; add vocabulary<\/em>. Add a vocabulary called \"Department.\" Disable hierarchy. For types, check \"Page\" and \"Story.\" Leave everything else at the defaults for now. Now click \"add terms\" in the Department row of the vocabulary table. Add two terms: \"Accounting\" and \"Public Relations.\" When users submit new content, they will have a chance to categorize it under one of these departments. So far, anyone can write for any department. The next four steps will restrict that privileges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Roles<\/strong><br \/>\n\tGo to <em>administer &gt; user management &gt; roles<\/em>. Add a role called \"accounting staff.\" Click \"edit permissions\" for that role. Check everything under \"node module\" except for \"administer content types.\" This gives your editors the ability to edit. Add another role called \"public relations staff\" and give them the same permissions. Ensure that you have disabled \"edit page content\" and \"edit story content\" under Node Module.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Access Control<\/strong><br \/>\n\tDownload and install the <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/taxonomy_access\" rel=\"nofollow\">taxonomy_access<\/a> module if you haven't already done so. Read the module's documentation now, or what follows may not make sense. Go to <em>administer &gt; user management &gt; taxonomy access: permissions<\/em>. Click on \"edit\" next to \"authenticated user.\" Expand the \"Departments\" menu. You should see three rows: \"Default,\" \"Accounting,\" and \"Public Relations.\" Set View to Allow, Update to Deny, and Delete to Deny for both departments and the default. Check \"List\" and uncheck \"Create\" for both departments and the default. This ensures that average users won't be able to modify any department's area.<\/p>\n<p>Now go back a screen and edit the accounting staff's permissions. Since you're currently editing the accounting staffers' privileges, you want to enable editing of their department's content and disable editing of the public relations department's content. Set Update and Delete to Allow in the Accounting row. Check \"Create\" in the accounting row. Check \"List\" in both rows. Set everything else to Ignore. Repeat the process for Public Relations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Assign Users to Roles<\/strong><br \/>\n\tGo to <em>administer &gt; user management<\/em>. Click \"edit\" next to a username and assign the user to either department. That user will now be able to edit her department's area, but not the other. If you want, you can give users access to both by assigning them to both roles.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to remember that the \"areas\" you have created are really an abstract thing. A node is part of an area simply by virtue of its categorization. To make your areas more concrete, you can pages that automatically list the nodes for the department. To do that, you can make a link or a menu item like this:<\/p>\n<p><code>&lt;a href=\"taxonomy\/term\/1\"&gt;Accounting&lt;\/a&gt;<\/code><\/p>\n<p>where 1 is the term id for Accounting.<\/p>\n<p>These steps create an editor role that has full executive control over its department. You will probably also want to create writer roles with scaled-back powers (probably just Create and not Update or Delete).<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: A related tutorial has been written 'Groups as Roles' at <a data-mce-=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/200631\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/200631\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/200631<\/a>.<\/p>\n<style>\n<!--\/*--><![CDATA[\/* ><!--*\/\n#sbap{display:none;visibility:hidden;}\n\/*--><!]]>*\/\n<\/style>"

The download file will be named drupal-x.y.tar.gz (or drupal-x.y.zip).<br \/>\n\t-All directories mentioned in this document are relative to the directory of your Drupal installation.<br \/>\n\t-Make a full backup of all files, directories, and your database(s) before starting, and save it outside your Drupal installation directory. Instructions may be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/upgrade\/backing-up-the-db\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/upgrade\/backing-up-the-db<\/a><br \/>\n\t-It is wise to try an update or upgrade on a test copy of your site before applying it to your live site. Even minor updates can cause your site's\u00a0 behavior to change.<br \/>\n\t-Each new release of Drupal has release notes, which explain the changes made since the previous version and any special instructions needed to update or upgrade to the new version. You can find a link to the release notes for the version you are upgrading or updating to on the Drupal project page(<a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/drupal\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/drupal<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><u><strong>UPGRADE PROBLEMS<\/strong><\/u><br \/>\n\tIf you encounter errors during this process,<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tNote any error messages you see.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>\n\t\tRestore your site to its previous state, using the file and database backups you created before you started the upgrade process. Do not attempt to do further upgrades on a site that had update problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>\n\t\tConsult one of the support options listed on <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/support\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/support<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>More in-depth information on upgrading can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/upgrade\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/upgrade<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\t<u><strong>MINOR VERSION UPDATES<\/strong><\/u><br \/>\n\tTo update from one minor 7.x version of Drupal to any later 7.x version, after following the instructions in the INTRODUCTION section at the top of this file:<\/p>\n<p>\t1. Log in as a user with the permission \"Administer software updates\".<\/p>\n<p>\t2. Go to Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Development &gt; Maintenance mode.\u00a0 Enable the \"Put site into maintenance mode\" checkbox and save the configuration.<\/p>\n<p>\t3. Remove all old core files and directories, except for the 'sites' directory and any custom files you added elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 If you made modifications to files like .htaccess or robots.txt, you will need to re-apply them from your backup, after the new files are in place.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes an update includes changes to default.settings.php (this will be noted in the release notes). If that's the case, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tMake a backup copy of your settings.php file, with a different file name.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>\n\t\tMake a copy of the new default.settings.php file, and name the copy settings.php (overwriting your previous settings.php file).<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>\n\t\tCopy the custom and site-specific entries from the backup you made into the new settings.php file. You will definitely need the lines giving the database information, and you will also want to copy in any other customizations you have added.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\n\t4. Download the latest Drupal 7.x release from <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\">http:\/\/drupal.org<\/a> to a directory outside of your web root. Extract the archive and copy the files into your Drupal directory.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 On a typical Unix\/Linux command line, use the following commands to download and extract:<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 wget <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/files\/projects\/drupal-x.y.tar.gz\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/files\/projects\/drupal-x.y.tar.gz<\/a><br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tar -zxvf drupal-x.y.tar.gz<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 This creates a new directory drupal-x.y\/ containing all Drupal files and directories. Copy the files into your Drupal installation directory:<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cp -R drupal-x.y\/* drupal-x.y\/.htaccess \/path\/to\/your\/installation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 If you do not have command line access to your server, download the archive from <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\">http:\/\/drupal.org<\/a> using your web browser, extract it, and then use an FTP client to upload the files to your web root.<\/p>\n<p>\t5. Re-apply any modifications to files such as .htaccess or robots.txt.<\/p>\n<p>\t6. Run update.php by visiting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/update.php\">http:\/\/www.example.com\/update.php<\/a> (replace <a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\">www.example.com<\/a> with your domain name). This will update the core database\u00a0 tables.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 If you are unable to access update.php do the following:<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Open settings.php with a text editor.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Find the line that says:<br \/><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $update_free_access = FALSE;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Change it into:<br \/><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $update_free_access = TRUE;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Once the upgrade is done, $update_free_access must be reverted to FALSE.<\/p>\n<p>\t7. Go to <strong>Administration &gt; Reports &gt; Status report<\/strong>. Verify that everything is working as expected.<\/p>\n<p>\t8. Ensure that <strong>$update_free_access is FALSE<\/strong> in settings.php.<\/p>\n<p>\t9. Go to <strong>Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Development &gt; Maintenance mode<\/strong>. Disable the \"Put site into maintenance mode\" checkbox and save the configuration.<\/p>\n<p>\t<u><strong>MAJOR VERSION UPGRADE<\/strong><\/u><br \/>\n\tTo upgrade from a previous major version of Drupal to Drupal 7.x, after following the instructions in the INTRODUCTION section at the top of this file:<\/p>\n<p>\t1. Check on the Drupal 7 status of your contributed and custom modules and themes. See <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/948216\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/948216<\/a> for information on upgrading contributed modules and themes. See <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/895314\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/895314<\/a> for a list of modules that have been moved into core for Drupal 7, and instructions on how to update them. See <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/update\/modules\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/update\/modules<\/a> for information on how to update your custom modules, and <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/update\/theme\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/update\/theme<\/a> for custom themes.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 You may decide at this point that you cannot upgrade your site, because needed modules or themes are not ready for Drupal 7.<\/p>\n<p>\t2. Update to the latest available version of Drupal 6.x (if your current version is Drupal 5.x, you have to upgrade to 6.x first). If you need to update, download Drupal 6.x and follow the instructions in its UPGRADE.txt. This document only applies for upgrades from 6.x to 7.x.<\/p>\n<p>\t3. In addition to updating to the latest available version of Drupal 6.x core, you must also upgrade all of your contributed modules for Drupal to their latest Drupal 6.x versions.<\/p>\n<p>\t4. Log in as user ID 1 (the site maintenance user).<\/p>\n<p>\t5. Go to <strong>Administer &gt; Site configuration &gt; Site maintenance<\/strong>. Select\u00a0 \"Off-line\" and save the configuration.<\/p>\n<p>\t6. Go to <strong>Administer &gt; Site building &gt; Themes<\/strong>. Enable \"Garland\" and select it as the default theme.<\/p>\n<p>\t7. Go to <strong>Administer &gt; Site building &gt; Modules<\/strong>. Disable all modules that are not\u00a0 listed under \"Core - required\" or \"Core - optional\". It is possible that some modules cannot be disabled, because others depend on them. Repeat this step until all non-core modules are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 If you know that you will not re-enable some modules for Drupal 7.x and you no longer need their data, then you can uninstall them under the Uninstall tab after disabling them.<\/p>\n<p>\t8. On the command line or in your FTP client, remove the file<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sites\/default\/default.settings.php<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t9. Remove all old core files and directories, except for the 'sites' directory and any custom files you added elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 If you made modifications to files like .htaccess or robots.txt, you will need to re-apply them from your backup, after the new files are in place.<\/p>\n<p>\t10. If you uninstalled any modules, remove them from the sites\/all\/modules and other sites\/*\/modules directories. Leave other modules in place, even though<br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0 they are incompatible with Drupal 7.x.<\/p>\n<p>\t11. Download the latest Drupal 7.x release from <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\">http:\/\/drupal.org<\/a> to a directory outside of your web root. Extract the archive and copy the files into your Drupal directory.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 On a typical Unix\/Linux command line, use the following commands to download\u00a0 and extract:<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong> wget <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/files\/projects\/drupal-x.y.tar.gz\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/files\/projects\/drupal-x.y.tar.gz<\/a><br \/>\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tar -zxvf drupal-x.y.tar.gz<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 This creates a new directory drupal-x.y\/ containing all Drupal files and directories. Copy the files into your Drupal installation directory:<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cp -R drupal-x.y\/* drupal-x.y\/.htaccess \/path\/to\/your\/installation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 If you do not have command line access to your server, download the archive from <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\">http:\/\/drupal.org<\/a> using your web browser, extract it, and then use an FTP client to upload the files to your web root.<\/p>\n<p>\t12. Re-apply any modifications to files such as .htaccess or robots.txt.<\/p>\n<p>\t13. Make your settings.php file writeable, so that the update process can convert it to the format of Drupal 7.x. settings.php is usually located in <strong>sites\/default\/settings.php<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t14. Run update.php by visiting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\/update.php\">http:\/\/www.example.com\/update.php<\/a> (replace <a href=\"http:\/\/www.example.com\">www.example.com<\/a> with your domain name). This will update the core database tables.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 If you are unable to access update.php do the following:<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Open settings.php with a text editor.<\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Find the line that says:<br \/><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $update_free_access = FALSE;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Change it into:<br \/><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $update_free_access = TRUE;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\t\u00a0\u00a0 - Once the upgrade is done, $update_free_access must be reverted to FALSE.<\/p>\n<p>\t15. Backup your database after the core upgrade has run.<\/p>\n<p>\t16. Replace and update your non-core modules and themes, following the procedures at <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/948216\">http:\/\/drupal.org\/node\/948216<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\t17. Go to <strong>Administration &gt; Reports &gt; Status report<\/strong>. Verify that everything is working as expected.<\/p>\n<p>\t18. Ensure that <strong>$update_free_access is FALSE<\/strong> in settings.php.<\/p>\n<p>\t19. Go to <strong>Administration &gt; Configuration &gt; Development &gt; Maintenance<\/strong> mode. Disable the \"Put site into maintenance mode\" checkbox and save the configuration.<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>The following are some basic popular models that are adopted by many software development firms<\/p>\n<p>A. System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model<br \/>\n\tB. Prototyping Model<br \/>\n\tC. Rapid Application Development Model<br \/>\n\tD. Component Assembly Model<\/p>\n<p><strong>A. System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model <\/strong><br \/>\n\tThis is also known as Classic Life Cycle Model (or) Linear Sequential Model (or) Waterfall Method. This model has the following activities.<br \/>\n\t1. System\/Information Engineering and Modeling As software is always of a large system (or business), work begins by establishing the requirements for all system elements and then allocating some subset of these requirements to software. This system view is essential when the software must interface with other elements such as hardware, people and other resources. System is the basic and very critical requirement for the existence of software in any entity. So if the system is not in place, the system should be engineered and put in place. In some cases, to extract the maximum output, the system should be re-engineered and spruced up. Once the ideal system is engineered or tuned, the development team studies the software requirement for the system.<br \/>\n\t2. Software Requirement Analysis This process is also known as feasibility study. In this phase, the development team visits the customer and studies their system. They investigate the need for possible software automation in the given system. By the end of the feasibility study, the team furnishes a document that holds the different specific recommendations for the candidate system. It also includes the personnel assignments, costs, project schedule, target dates etc.... The requirement gathering process is intensified and focused specially on software. To understand the nature of the program(s) to be built, the system engineer or \"Analyst\" must understand the information domain for the software, as well as required function, behavior, performance and interfacing. The essential purpose of this phase is to find the need and to define the problem that needs to be solved .<br \/>\n\t3. System Analysis and Design In this phase, the software development process, the software's overall structure and its nuances are defined. In terms of the client\/server technology, the number of tiers needed for the package architecture, the database design, the data structure design etc... are all defined in this phase. A software development model is thus created. Analysis and Design are very crucial in the whole development cycle. Any glitch in the design phase could be very expensive to solve in the later stage of the software development. Much care is taken during this phase. The logical system of the product is developed in this phase.<br \/>\n\t4. Code Generation The design must be translated into a machine-readable form. The code generation step performs this task. If the design is performed in a detailed manner, code generation can be accomplished without much complication. Programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers etc... are used to generate the code. Different high level programming languages like C, C++, Pascal, Java are used for coding. With respect to the type of application, the right programming language is chosen.<br \/>\n\t5. Testing Once the code is generated, the software program testing begins. Different testing methodologies are available to unravel the bugs that were committed during the previous phases. Different testing tools and methodologies are already available. Some companies build their own testing tools that are tailor made for their own development operations.<br \/>\n\t6. Maintenance The software will definitely undergo change once it is delivered to the customer. There can be many reasons for this change to occur. Change could happen because of some unexpected input values into the system. In addition, the changes in the system could directly affect the software operations. The software should be developed to accommodate changes that could happen during the post implementation period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>B. Prototyping Model<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThis is a cyclic version of the linear model. In this model, once the requirement analysis is done and the design for a prototype is made, the development process gets started. Once the prototype is created, it is given to the customer for evaluation. The customer tests the package and gives his\/her feed back to the developer who refines the product according to the customer's exact expectation. After a finite number of iterations, the final software package is given to the customer. In this methodology, the software is evolved as a result of periodic shuttling of information between the customer and developer. This is the most popular development model in the contemporary IT industry. Most of the successful software products have been developed using this model - as it is very difficult (even for a whiz kid!) to comprehend all the requirements of a customer in one shot. There are many variations of this model skewed with respect to the project management styles of the companies. New versions of a software product evolve as a result of prototyping.<\/p>\n<p><strong>C. Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe RAD modelis a linear sequential software development process that emphasizes an extremely short development cycle. The RAD model is a \"high speed\" adaptation of the linear sequential model in which rapid development is achieved by using a component-based construction approach. Used primarily for information systems applications, the RAD approach encompasses the following phases: 1. Business modeling The information flow among business functions is modeled in a way that answers the following<br \/>\n\tquestions: What information drives the business process?<br \/>\n\tWhat information is generated?<br \/>\n\tWho generates it?<br \/>\n\tWhere does the information go?<br \/>\n\tWho processes it?<br \/>\n\t2. Data modeling The information flow defined as part of the business modeling phase is refined into a set of data objects that are needed to support the business. The characteristic (called attributes) of each object is identified and the relationships between these objects are defined.<br \/>\n\t3. Process modeling The data objects defined in the data-modeling phase are transformed to achieve the information flow necessary to implement a business function. Processing the descriptions are created for adding, modifying, deleting, or retrieving a data object.<br \/>\n\t4. Application generation The RAD model assumes the use of the RAD tools like VB, VC++, Delphi etc... rather than creating software using conventional third generation programming languages. The RAD model works to reuse existing program components (when possible) or create reusable components (when necessary). In all cases, automated tools are used to facilitate construction of the software.<br \/>\n\t5. Testing and turnover Since the RAD process emphasizes reuse, many of the program components have already been tested. This minimizes the testing and development time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>D. Component Assembly Model<\/strong><br \/>\n\tObject technologies provide the technical framework for a component-based process model for software engineering. The object oriented paradigm emphasizes the creation of classes that encapsulate both data and the algorithm that are used to manipulate the data. If properly designed and implemented, object oriented classes are reusable across different applicationsand computer based system architectures. Component Assembly Model leads to software reusability. The integration\/assembly of the already existing software components accelerate the development process. Nowadays many component libraries are available on the Internet. If the right components are chosen, the integration aspect is made much simpler.<\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>If you take a look at the 'blocks' administration page in Drupal, you will see that regions are essentially containers to which you can add those blocks. You can also add other non-block content to a region using PHP. An example of a region is your sidebar.<\/p>\n<p>These regions can be assigned to either the whole page or any other themed elements, including in nodes or comments.<\/p>\n<p>The PHPTemplate engine defines five default regions: left, right, content, header, and footer. To implement these regions, themes need only include <code>$sidebar_left<\/code>, <code>$sidebar_right<\/code>, <code>$content<\/code>, <code>$header<\/code>, and <code>$footer_message<\/code>variables in their page.tpl.php files, e.g., <code><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$header<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><\/code>.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tHow to define custom regions<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to have your own set of regions for a theme, you do this by defining a <code>_regions()<\/code>hook. In this case, your custom regions will override those defined by default in PHPTemplate.<\/p>\n<p>If the theme doesn't have a template.php file in its directory, create one; otherwise use the existing template.php file. In either case, add a <code>mytheme_regions()<\/code>function to define your regions. Each region needs to have a name (a string with no spaces) and a description (the text that will show up in, for example, the block configuration pages). The following would define all the standard PHPTemplate regions except the left sidebar and, in addition, two new regions for a theme called \"mytheme\".<\/p>\n<div id=\"lodn\"><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"codeblock\">\n\t<code><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php<br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">function <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">mytheme_regions<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">() {<br \/>\u00a0 return array(<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'right' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">=&gt; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">t<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'right sidebar'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">),<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'content' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">=&gt; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">t<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'content'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">),<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'header' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">=&gt; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">t<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'header'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">),<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'footer' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">=&gt; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">t<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'footer'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">),<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'floater' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">=&gt; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">t<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'floater'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">),<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'inline1' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">=&gt; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">t<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'inline 1'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">)<br \/>\u00a0 );<br \/>}<br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><\/code><\/div>\n<p><strong>Note: <\/strong>Regarding the name of the function:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tuse the name of your theme instead of mytheme_regions(), eg: bluemarine_regions()<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tDon't use a hyphen in the name of a region; an underscore is OK.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tAlso, your theme name is your <i>base theme name<\/i> not the name of your style.css directory (if you are using one). For example, box_cleanslate overrides the style.css file of the box_grey theme; therefore you should name your function <em>box_grey_regions<\/em>.<\/li>\n<\/ul><h2>\n\tHow to write the theme's region variables to the page.<\/h2>\n<p>If you're assigning your region to page.tpl.php, you don't need to worry about creating a variable for your region and assigning content to it; PHPTemplate handles this automatically. All you need to do is write the variables to the page, by editing your theme's page.tpl.php file. For each new region you've defined, include in page.tpl.php a print call. For the 'floater' region defined above, this would look like:<\/p>\n<p><code><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$floater<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">;<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you'll probably want to use HTML, CSS, and possibly PHP (e.g., if tests) to get your new regions looking how you want them.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tInline regions: how to assign regions to nodes, comments, etc.<\/h2>\n<p>By default, all defined regions are passed to page.tpl.php. But with an extra step you can also choose to make specific regions available to any other template file: node.tpl.php, comment.tpl.php, etc. Here's how.<\/p>\n<p>In the same template.php file as you defined the regions in, define a <code>function _phptemplate_variables()<\/code>(or use an existing one if there's one already defined). What you'll do here is assign region content to a specific theme call. When <code>_phptemplate_variables()<\/code>is called, it receives the theme argument as the <code>$hook<\/code>variable, for instance 'node'. So we can assign new regions to the node template like this:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"codeblock\">\n\t<code><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php<br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">function <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">_phptemplate_variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$hook<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">, <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) {<br \/>\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #FF8000\">\/\/ Load the node region only if we're not in a teaser view.<br \/>\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">if (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$hook <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">== <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'node' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">&amp;&amp; !<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$vars<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">[<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'teaser'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">]) {<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #FF8000\">\/\/ Load region content assigned via blocks.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">foreach (array(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'inline1'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) as <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) {<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">[<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">] = <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">theme<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'blocks'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">, <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">);<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }<br \/>\u00a0 }<br \/>\u00a0 return <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">;<br \/>}<br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><\/code><\/div>\n<p>Note that we're testing to make sure we aren't in a 'teaser' view, so that the region will be loaded only in a full node view.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in your node template, you can include the region variable in your output. Here's the standard phptemplate node.tpl.php with an 'inline1' region added:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"codeblock\">\n\t<code>\u00a0 &lt;div class=\"node<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">if (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$sticky<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) { print <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">\" sticky\"<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">; } <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">if (!<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$status<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) { print <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">\" node-unpublished\"<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">; } <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span>\"&gt;<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">if (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$picture<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) {<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$picture<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">;<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">if (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$page <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">== <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">0<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) { <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;h2 class=\"title\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$node_url?&gt;<\/span><\/span>\"&gt;<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$title?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">}; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &lt;span class=\"submitted\"&gt;<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$submitted?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;\/span&gt;<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &lt;span class=\"taxonomy\"&gt;<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$terms?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;\/span&gt;<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"floatleft\"&gt;<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$inline1?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;\/div&gt;<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$content?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;\/div&gt;<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">if (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$links<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) { <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;div class=\"links\"&gt;&amp;raquo; <span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">print <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$links?&gt;<\/span><\/span>&lt;\/div&gt;<span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">}; <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\u00a0 &lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/div>\n<p>Likely you'll want to add style declarations to the region, which you do as usual via the theme's style.css file. Here, for example, we could make the inline region float left:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"codeblock\">\n\t<code>div.floatleft {<br \/>\u00a0 float: left;<br \/>}<\/code><\/div>\n<p>Because a node's variables are passed to other node templates, you can also do your customized display in node-type templates.<\/p>\n<p>And this same basic approach can be applied to any other themed area. This example assigns specific regions to nodes and comments:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div class=\"codeblock\">\n\t<code><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">&lt;?php<br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">function <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">_phptemplate_variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$hook<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">, <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) {<br \/>\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #FF8000\">\/\/ Load region content assigned via blocks.<br \/>\u00a0 \/\/ Load the node region only if we're not in a teaser view.<br \/>\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">if (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$hook <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">== <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'node' <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">&amp;&amp; !<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">[<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'teaser'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">]) {<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 foreach (array(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'node1'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">, <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'node2'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) as <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) {<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">[<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">] = <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">theme<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'blocks'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">, <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">);<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }<br \/>\u00a0 }<br \/>\u00a0 else if (<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$hook <\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">== <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'commment'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) {<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 foreach (array(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'comment1'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">, <\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'comment2'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) as <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">) {<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">[<\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">] = <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">theme<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">(<\/span><span style=\"color: #DD0000\">'blocks'<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">, <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$region<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">);<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 }<br \/>\u00a0 }<br \/>\u00a0 return <\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">$variables<\/span><span style=\"color: #007700\">;<br \/>}<br \/><\/span><span style=\"color: #0000BB\">?&gt;<\/span><\/span><\/code><\/div>\n<h2>\n\tRegions without blocks<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to assign content to regions but not have it output via blocks, do so with the <code>drupal_set_content()<\/code>function. This allows you to bypass the regular block system. Try something like this:<\/p>\n<p><em>Set content to regions<\/em><br \/>\n\tIn your module code, set content to the regions. You can use region names that aren't listed in your themename_regions() array. That way, the regions won't be available for blocks, and so won't end up with block content in them. Say your regions are called 'region1' and 'region2'.

            "articleBody": "<div>\n\tDrupal often gets criticized by those who look to its source code and API expecting to find certain familiar aspects of object-oriented programming (OOP). For example, the word \"class\" does not appear in Drupal code as often as some might expect. Some have viewed this as a deficiency.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tAlthough Drupal does not make thorough use of the native OOP features of PHP, the Drupal code base and API does reflect some principles found in object-oriented programming and design. This article describes the architecture of Drupal from an OOP perspective, so that programmers familiar with OOP can evaluate Drupal in light of object-oriented design principles, and hopefully feel more at home in the Drupal code base. In the future, as both PHP and Drupal become more mature, Drupal may increasingly adopt the native OOP features of PHP.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Motivations for Current Design<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tBack as far as version 4.6 of Drupal, the decision was made not to use PHP's class construct. This decision was made for several reasons.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tFirst, PHP's support for object-oriented constructs was much less mature at the time of Drupal's design. Drupal was built on PHP 4, and most of the improvements in PHP 5 relate to its object-oriented features.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tSecond, Drupal code is highly compartmentalized into modules, each of which defines its own set of functions. The inclusion of files is handled inside functions as well; PHP's performance suffers if unneeded code is included, so Drupal attempts to load as little code as possible per request. This is a critical consideration, especially in the absence of a PHP accelerator: the act of compiling the code accounts for more than half of the time to complete a Drupal page request. Functions are therefore defined inside other functions in Drupal, with respect to the runtime scope. While this is perfectly legal for bare functions, PHP does not allow the same kind of nesting with class declarations. This means that the inclusion of files defining classes must be \"top-level,\" and not inside any function, which leads either to slower code (always including the files defining classes) or a large amount of logic in the main index.php file.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tFinally, Drupal attempts to adopt some OOP design aspects that PHP's OOP system does not yet support, or did not support at the time of adoption.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tFor instance, the Drupal theme system relies on an OOP concept similar to Objective-C's \"categories\", (this concept is also similarly known as 'open classes' in Ruby, 'modifying object prototypes' in Javascript, or 'extension methods' in C#).<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tIn Drupal 7, some of this has changed: Drupal 7, for the first time, requires PHP 5, and there are now a few modules in Drupal that use PHP's class system. However, the central structure of Drupal remains the same, and most of Drupal still does not use the PHP class construct.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>OOP Concepts in Drupal<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tDespite the lack of explicitly-declared classes in Drupal, many object-oriented paradigms are still used in its design. There are many sets of \"essential features\" that are said to be necessary to classify a system as object-oriented; we will look at one of the more popular definitions and examine some ways in which the central architecture of Drupal exhibits those characteristics.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Objects<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThere are many constructs in Drupal that fit the description of an \"object\". Some of the more prominent Drupal components that could be considered objects are modules, themes, nodes, and users.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tNodes are the basic content building blocks of a Drupal site, and bundle together the data that makes up a \"page\" or \"story\" on a typical site. The methods that operate on this object are defined in node.module, usually called by the node_invoke() function. User objects similarly package data together, bringing together information about each account on the site, profile information, and session tracking. In both cases, the data structure is defined by a database table instead of a class. Drupal exploits the relational nature of its supported databases to allow other modules to extend the objects with additional data fields.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tModules and themes are object-like as well, filling the \"controller\" role in many ways. Each module is a source file, but also bundles together related functions and follows a pattern of defining Drupal hooks.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Abstraction<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tDrupal's hook system is the basis for its interface abstraction. Hooks define the operations that can be performed on or by a module. If a module implements a hook, it enters into a contract to perform a particular task or return a particular type of information when the hook is invoked. The calling code need not know anything about the module or the way the hook is implemented in order to get useful work done by invoking the hook.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Encapsulation<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tLike most other object-oriented systems, Drupal does not have a way of strictly limiting access to an object's inner workings, but rather relies on convention to accomplish this. Since Drupal code is based around functions, which share a single namespace, this namespace is subdivided by the use of prefixes. By following this simple convention, each module can declare its own functions and variables without the worry of conflict with others.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tConvention also delineates the public API of a class from its internal implementation. Internal functions are prefixed by an underscore to indicate that they should not be called by outside modules. For example, _user_categories() is a private function which is subject to change without notice, while user_save() is part of the public interface to the user object and can be called with the expectation that the user object will be saved to the database (even though the method of doing this is private).<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Polymorphism<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tNodes are polymorphic in the classical sense. If a module needs to display a node, for example, it can call node_build() on that node, followed by drupal_render(), to get an HTML representation. The actual rendering, though, will depend on which type of node is passed to the function; this is directly analogous to having the class of an object determine its behavior when a message is sent to it. Drupal itself handles the same introspection tasks required of an OOP language's runtime library.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tFurthermore, the rendering of the node in this example can be affected by the active theme. Themes are polymorphic in the same way; the theme is passed a \"render this node\" message, and responds to it in a different way depending on the implementation of the active theme, though the interface is constant.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Inheritance<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tModules and themes can also be thought of as classes that inherit their behavior from an abstract base class (although both can also define whatever functions they please). In the case of themes, the behavior of the abstract base class is determined by the functions in theme.inc and the default theming implementations in enabled modules. A theme can either override the default rendering of any interface component or let the default rendering be used. Modules similarly have the selection of all Drupal hooks to override at will, and may pick and choose which ones to implement.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Design Patterns in Drupal<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tMuch of Drupal's internal structure is more complicated than simple inheritance and polymorphism, however. The more interesting features of the system result from using established software design patterns. Many of the patterns detailed in the seminal \"Gang of Four\" (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides) Design Patterns book can be observed in Drupal, for instance.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Singleton<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tIf we are to think of modules and themes as objects, then they follow the singleton pattern. In general these objects do not encapsulate data; what separates one module from another is the set of functions it contains, so it should be thought of as a class with a singleton instance.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Decorator<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tDrupal makes extensive use of the decorator pattern. The polymorphism of node objects was discussed earlier, but this is only a small piece of the power of the node system. More interesting is the use of the various node hooks (hook_node_load(), hook_node_view(), etc.), which allow arbitrary modules to extend the behavior of all nodes.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThis feature allows for a wide variety of behaviors to be added to nodes without the need for subclassing. For instance, a basic story node has only a few pieces of associated data: title, author, body, teaser, and a handful of metadata. A common need is for files to be uploaded and attached to a node, so one could design a new node type that had the story node's features plus the ability to attach files. Drupal's upload module satisfies this need in a much more modular fashion by using the node API to grant every node that requests it the ability to have attached files.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThis behavior could be imitated by the use of decorators, wrapping them around each node object. More simply, languages that support categories, like Objective-C, could augment the common base class of all node objects to add the new behavior. Drupal's implementation is a simple ramification of the hook system and the presence of node_invoke().<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Observer<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThe above interaction is also similar to the use of observers in object-oriented systems. This Observer pattern is pervasive throughout Drupal, as many of Drupal's hooks essentially allow modules to register as observers of Drupal's objects. For instance, when a modification is made to a vocabulary in Drupal's taxonomy system, a taxonomy hook such as hook_taxonomy_vocabulary_update() is called in all modules that implement it. By implementing the hook, the modules have registered as observers of the vocabulary object; any changes to it can then be acted on as is appropriate.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Bridge<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThe Drupal database abstraction layer is implemented in a fashion similar to the Bridge design pattern. Modules need to be written in a way that is independent of the database system being used, and the abstraction layer provides for this. New database layers can be written that conform to the API defined by the bridge, adding support for additional database systems without the need to modify module code.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Chain of Responsibility<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tDrupal's menu system follows the Chain of Responsibility pattern. On each page request, the menu system determines whether there is a module to handle the request, whether the user has access to the resource requested, and which function will be called to do the work. To do this, a message is passed to the menu item corresponding to the path of the request. If the menu item cannot handle the request, it is passed up the chain. This continues until a module handles the request, a module denies access to the user, or the chain is exhausted.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Command<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tMany of Drupal's hooks use the Command pattern to reduce the number of functions that are necessary to implement, passing the operation as a parameter along with the arguments. In fact, the hook system itself uses this pattern, so that modules do not have to define every hook, but rather just the ones they care to implement.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Why Not to Use Classes<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tThe above hopefully clarifies the ways in which Drupal embodies various OOP concepts. Why, then, doesn't Drupal move in the direction of using classes to solve these problems in the future? Some of the reasons are historical, and were discussed earlier. Others, though, become clearer now that we have stepped through some of the design patterns used in Drupal.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tA good example is the extensibility of the theme system. A theme defines functions for each of the interface elements it wants to display in a special way. As noted earlier, this makes themes seem like a good candidate to inherit from an abstract base class that defines the default rendering of the elements.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tWhat happens, though, when a module is added that adds a new interface element? The theme should be able to override the rendering of this element as well, but if a base class is defined, the new module has no way of adding another method to that class. Complicated patterns could be set up to emulate this behavior, but Drupal's theme architecture quite elegantly handles the situation using its own function dispatch system. In this case and others like it, the classes that on the surface would seem to simplify the system would end up making it more cumbersome and difficult to extend.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Room for Improvement<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tWhile Drupal does reflect many object-oriented practices, there are some aspects of OOP that could be brought to bear on the project in more powerful ways.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tEncapsulation, while adequate in theory, is not applied consistently enough across the code base. Modules should more rigorously define which functions are public and which are private; the tendency right now is to publish most functions in the public namespace even if the interface is volatile. This problem is exacerbated by Drupal's policy of forgoing backward compatibility in exchange for cleaner APIs whenever necessary. This policy has led to some very good code, but would need to be excercised much less often if better encapsulation conventions were followed.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tInheritance is also weak in the system. While, as noted above, all modules share a common set of behavior, it is difficult to extend this to new modules. One can create new modules easily that augment the behavior of existing ones, but there is not a way to override just some of a module's behavior. The impact of this can be marginalized by breaking large modules into smaller \"a la carte\" bundles of functionality, so that undesired aspects of a module may be more easily left out of the system.<\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Multiple Paradigms<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n\tDrupal is on the surface a procedural system, because it is built in a procedural language (PHP without classes). The paradigm behind a piece of software is not entirely dependent on its representation in code, however. Drupal is not afraid to borrow concepts from many disparate programming paradigms where it is convenient. A great deal of the power of Drupal comes from its underlying relational database, and relational programming techniques that mirror it. The fact that Drupal's work, much like that of any web application, consists of many reactions to discrete and rapid page requests should make the behavior of the system resonate with proponents of event-driven programming. To an aspect-oriented programmer, the invocation of hooks in arbitrary modules may look strikingly similar to a pointcut. And, as should be abundantly clear by now, Drupal is no stranger to object-oriented concepts either.<\/div>\n"

The goal is to have content translated to two or more languages and the visitor to be able to choose any of them. Also, the menus must follow the selection. I have tested the result with content types <em>page<\/em> and <em>story<\/em>. I don't know what happens with <em>forum<\/em>, for example. I hope this helps you.<\/p>\n<p>In the parentheses I give the relative path in the url. So, if your site is <a href=\"http:\/\/example.com\/drupal\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http:\/\/example.com\/drupal\">http:\/\/example.com\/drupal<\/a> and in parentheses I give <em>admin\/build\/modules<\/em>, then the url becomes: <a href=\"http:\/\/example.com\/drupal\/admin\/build\/modules\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http:\/\/example.com\/drupal\/admin\/build\/modules\">http:\/\/example.com\/drupal\/admin\/build\/modules<\/a><\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tInstall <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/i18n\" rel=\"nofollow\">Internationalization<\/a> module<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tGo to the modules (admin\/build\/modules) and in <em>Core - optional<\/em> section enable<\/li>\n<\/ol><ul><li>\n\t\tLocale<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tContent translation<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>\n\t\tIn the <em>Multilanguage - i18n<\/em> section enable all available.

If you don't want them, in the <em>Multilanguage - i18n<\/em> don't enable Multilanguage Poll and Multilanguage Profile.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tSave<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>You now need the translation files for all the available languages of your site (if you haven't got them already). Go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/Translations\" rel=\"nofollow\">translations<\/a> page and download. Then extract them to Drupal's folder (see at 2 minutes 30 seconds into this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lullabot.com\/videocast\/installing-drupal-translation\" rel=\"nofollow\">videocast<\/a> for the correct way to extract translations; you can ignore the rest of the video as it deals with installing Drupal in a language other than English, while this page deals with adding a language after Drupal has already been installed).<\/p>\n<p>You have to add this language:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n\t\tGo to the <em>Languages<\/em> page (admin\/settings\/language)<\/li>\n<\/ol><ul><li>\n\t\tAdd all the languages you downloaded and extracted (admin\/settings\/language\/add)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tChoose <strong>Configure<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tIn the <em>Language negotiation<\/em> choose <strong>Path prefix only<\/strong> and save settings<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>\n\t\tMake sure English is the default language<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tGo to the blocks (admin\/build\/block)<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tIn the <em>Disabled<\/em> area choose a Region for the <strong>Language switcher<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tChoose <strong>Save blocks<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Ok, now you are at a good point.

            "articleBody": "<p>Allow modules to interact with the Drupal core.<\/p>\n<p>Drupal's module system is based on the concept of \"hooks\". A hook is a PHP function that is named foo_bar(), where \"foo\" is the name of the module (whose filename is thus foo.module) and \"bar\" is the name of the hook. Each hook has a defined set of parameters and a specified result type.<\/p>\n<p>To extend Drupal, a module need simply implement a hook. When Drupal wishes to allow intervention from modules, it determines which modules implement a hook and calls that hook in all enabled modules that implement it.<\/p>\n<p>The available hooks to implement are explained here in the Hooks section of the developer documentation. The string \"hook\" is used as a placeholder for the module name in the hook definitions. For example, if the module file is called example.module, then <a class=\"local\" href=\"http:\/\/api.drupal.org\/api\/drupal\/developer%21hooks%21core.php\/function\/hook_help\/6\" title=\"Provide online user help.\">hook_help<\/a>() as implemented by that module would be defined as example_help().<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tFunctions &amp; methods<\/h3>\n<table class=\"sticky-enabled sticky-table\"><thead class=\"tableHeader-processed\"><tr><th>\n\t\t\t\tName<\/th>\n<th>\n\t\t\t\tDescription<\/th>\n<\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr class=\"odd\"><td>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/api.drupal.org\/api\/drupal\/developer%21hooks%21core.php\/function\/custom_url_rewrite_inbound\/6\">custom_url_rewrite_inbound<\/a><\/td>\n<td>\n\t\t\t\tcustom_url_rewrite_inbound is not a hook, it's a function you can add to settings.php to alter incoming requests so they map to a Drupal path.

            "articleBody": "<p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a well-established server-side dynamic language platform for Web development. Among its many users have been important Web properties such as SugarCRM and the Drupal content management system. Perhaps the top promoter of PHP is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/d\/cloud-computing\/zend-vmware-partner-php-cloud-deployments-201169\">Zend Technologies<\/a>, which offers an application server and development tools for PHP and stresses PHP usage in enterprises.<\/p>\n<p>Andi Gutmans, Zend's CEO and co-founder, has been a key participant in the ongoing development of PHP since the 1990s. He spoke with InfoWorld Editor at Large Paul Krill, praising PHP's role in cloud and mobile computing while defending its security capabilities and performance. He also talked about PHP's status vis \u00e0 vis other languages, even asserting that PHP has put Perl down for the count when it comes to languages.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> What really drove your decision to work with PHP, and why has PHP become so prevalent?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> What drove us to work on PHP was mainly fun. We were at university, we did a project. We just finished a compiler course, which basically gives you the foundation to build a language, so we put a lot of time into just for fun trying to make this better. We had no commercial aspirations, we just did it for fun. We went back to [PHP founder Rasmus Lerdorf] and we said, \"Why don't you embrace this new version because we think it's better?\" That's what happened, and the whole PHP project moved over to what we built, and it became a phenomenal success. It was actually only about three years later when we started to think about building a commercial business around PHP.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> What role does PHP, a server-side platform, have in the realm of mobile device applications?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> Mobile is all about engaging users, engaging partners, and doing that in a much more effective way. As part of that engagement, we think it's about personalizing the experience and creating the right context for the mobile user. That context gets created on the server side because it's an aggregate of what we know from the mobile device, what we know from our existing systems, what we know from social platforms. So the server side is very, very critical, maybe even more critical than the client side to create these personalized experiences because it actually has to do all the heavy lifting of bringing all these different systems together and personalizing the response and the data for consumption by the client side.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you're accessing your bank's Web application, let's say you're on Wells Fargo, and you want to know where the ATMs are in your neighborhood. Your location will go to a server side, the server side will do all the mapping, and maybe it knows who you are and it knows you don't like a certain ATM and it could actually personalize that response and send it back to the client. Server side is critical to building these new experiences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> What's the main driver for PHP in cloud computing?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> A lot of people think of cloud as the what, and I think it's the how. Mobile is a big piece of the what, like mobile application development is really one of the highest-priority items for organizations. What happens, though, is as you're building mobile, you're engaging external to the organization, and you need to be able to do a few things. You need to have a much more agile development and production process, which cloud is really good at because there's a lot of automation. You can do automation without cloud, but I'd say cloud is a lot easier and a lot more relevant.<\/p>\n<p>The second thing is you're reaching billions of users on mobile devices potentially, so having the elastic scale of cloud becomes very, very important. While you don't have to use cloud to deliver mobile apps, we believe that mobile application development pulls with it cloud usage because cloud is such a great runtime platform for serving mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> The two languages most often mentioned in the same breath with PHP would be Perl and Python. Would you agree with that?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> Probably today it's Ruby and Python. I think Perl is long gone, thanks to PHP.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> What does Python offer that those three -- Perl, Ruby, or Python -- don't offer?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> We think PHP is actually the only ecosystem today that is enterprise-grade and ready to take on Java and .Net. Ruby and Python are nice languages, but if you look at it from a commercialization and professionalization point of view, only PHP has a company like Zend that really supports the runtime. Only PHP has worked with the IBMs, Oracles, and Microsofts of the world and really made sure that the interpretability to enterprise systems works well. And only PHP has the application ecosystem that is everywhere, like Drupal, Magento, and WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>When you look at it from a vendor support point of view, the partner ecosystem, the application ecosystem, the tool chain, and when we go to enterprise we will never actually see those other languages. It will always be Java and .Net, and we believe that PHP today is ready to take them on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> I saw an online article from 2006 that referred to PHP as \"Pretty Hard to Protect.\" You mentioned this morning that PHP has an undeserved reputation as far as security deficiencies. What has been done to shore up security concerns in PHP, and what's going to be done going forward?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> First of all, Web security is really hard for anyone. It's very hard to get the training and the best practices to build secure apps. It doesn't matter what language you're using. What helps developers build secure applications is having the right frameworks that lead you into building applications in the right way. And the PHP ecosystem has, since 2005 I would say, built out several frameworks that are enterprise-grade.<\/p>\n<p>The leading one is Zend Framework, and Zend Framework really helps instill those best practices that enable companies to build secure Web applications. If you're using a professional framework today, you're just as secure on PHP as you are with any other language. If you're hacking something, you have no skill set, then of course no matter what language you use you're not going to build secure apps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> Would you say the \"Pretty Hard to Protect\" acronym definition is no longer accurate?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> PHP applications are just as secure as any other application today as long as you're using a good framework, like in any other language.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> What other PHP frameworks are there besides Zend Framework?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> There's Symfony, there's CakePHP, and even more than that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> What about the concern over PHP being slower to execute than languages like C?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> I'm a C developer by heart. Absolutely any dynamic language -- including Java and .Net -- is slower than C. C as a language is very close to the bare metal. PHP is one of the fastest dynamic languages. There's a lot of optimization that's gone into it, including work we've done with Intel and other vendors. It's actually very, very fast.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing to remember, though, is the language runtime is one aspect of performance. The reality is a lot of the performance bottlenecks in Web applications are actually I\/O. It's network access, database access, file system access, and no matter how fast your runtime is, if that is your bottleneck, it's going to be your bottleneck. You can write it in Assembly, and that's what is going to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the long-term prospect of Web application performance in some cases actually is becoming increasingly challenged because you're building these cloud apps. No matter what language you're using, you're consuming different Web services. Well, Web services by definition are slow. We're going to see increased challenges around application performance as we build these cloud native applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>InfoWorld:<\/strong> What was the most recent release of PHP?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gutmans:<\/strong> The most recent was PHP 5.4. That was a very important release because it was a significant step up in performance. We also had a functionality called Traits, which is another object-oriented feature. We had a nicer way to create arrays in PHP 5.4, which is just easier to use. A big change in the Zend Engine [within PHP] was the fact that we reduced memory consumption and increased performance. That was a big step up. We also added support for multibyte languages out of the box.<\/p>\n<p>Article source :\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/d\/application-development\/zend-ceo-php-fit-the-enterprise-205758\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/d\/application-development\/zend-ceo-php-fit-the-enterprise-205758<\/a><\/p>\n"

            "articleBody": "<p>A decision tree (or tree diagram) is a dicision support tool that uses a tree like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resources costs and utility. Decision trees have vast applications in operations research and decision analysis for identifying a strategy most likely to reach a specific goal. It is widely used for project policy decision making. Another use of decision tree is as a descriptive means for calculating conditional probabilities.<\/p>\n<p>A decision tree analysis is a specific technique in which a diagram(dicision tree) is used for the purposes of assisting the project leader and the project team in making a difficult decision. The decision tree is a diagram that presents the decision under consideration and, along different branches, the implications that may arise from choosing one path or another. The decision tree analysis is often conducted when a number of future outcomes of scenarious remains uncertain, and is a form of brainstroming which, when descision making, can help to assure all factors are given proper consideration.<\/p>\n<p>A decision tree is a logical model represented as a binary (two-way split) tree that shows how the value of a target variable can be predicated by using the values of a set of predictor variables. It can be described as an algorthim or a formal step-wise process used in coming to a conclusion or making a judgment. An example of the decision tree is shown below -<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/decision_tree_concepts.png\" style=\"width: 622px; height: 304px; float: left;\" \/>The decision tree for choosing between two products X and Y. A company has to decide upon development of two products X and Y. They can develop only one product at a time. For developing the product X, they have to make an initial investment of INR 2 Lakh, whereas for developing the product Y, they have to make an intial investment of INR 3 Lakh. Now as per the decision tree, in case of opting the product X, there is probability of 0.7 that the return in one year will be INR 1 Lakh and there is probability of 0.3 that the return will be INR 3 Lakh. Now, if the product Y is opted, there is probability of 0.4 that the return will be INR 2 Lakh after a year and there is probability of 0.6 that the return will be INR 3 Lakh after a year. Now, after analyzing the decision tree, it is possible to get an insight of the future prospects (expected returns) of both the products and accordingly it is possible for the company to choose the most profitable product for development.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Parts of a Decision Tree<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The main components of any Decision Tree are the nodes. There are different type of nodes in a Decision Tree. These are as follows :<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n\t\tParent Nodes<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tChild Nodes<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tInterior Nodes<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\tTerminal or Leaf Nodes<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/decision_tree.png\" style=\"width: 622px; height: 304px; float: left;\" \/><strong>Parent Nodes -<\/strong> Parent nodes are the nodes from where the two or more new nodes use to come out in the decision tree are called parent nodes. Parent Node does not come out of any other node.<br \/>\n\tNode 1 is the Parent Node in the figure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Child Nodes -<\/strong> Child Nodes are the nodes that come out of the parent nodes in a Decision Tree. Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6 and Node 7 are the child nodes in the figure.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>Interior Nodes -<\/strong> Nodes that have come out of another node and having one or more child nodes in a Decision Tree are termed as the Interior Nodes. Node 2 and Node 3 are the interior nodes in figure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Terminal or Leaf Nodes -<\/strong> Nodes that do not have any child node are termed as Terminal or Leaf Nodes. Node 4, Node 5, Node 6 and Node 7 are the Terminal or Leaf Nodes in the figure.<\/p>\n<p>A decision tree is constructed by a split that divides a particular group in node (Parent Node) into two or more groups (child nodes). The same procedure is applied to split the child groups. This process is termed as the 'recursive partitioning'. The split is selected to construct a tree that can be used to predict the value of the target variable.<br \/>\n\t\u00a0<\/p>\n"

However, in case of project management, everything should be handled in a creative as well as flexiable manner, and the project manager should posses the ability to adjust rapidly to the changing scenario. So handling of projects needs application of advanced quantitative techniques as well as tools in order to meet the targets along with meticulous planning.<\/p>\n<p>There is huge application of probability and other statistical concepts in efficient project planning and implementation.

            "articleBody": "<p><strong>Failproof investing principles Warren Buffet bets on:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Choose Simplicity over Complexity<\/strong><br \/>\n\tWhen investing, keep it simple. Do what\u2019s easy and obvious. If you don\u2019t understand a business, don\u2019t buy it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Make Your Own Investment Decisions<\/strong><br \/>\n\tDon\u2019t listen to the brokers, the analysts, or the pundits. Figure it out for yourself.Become a value investor. It\u2019s proven to be a very rewarding technique over the long term.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Maintain Proper Temperament<\/strong><br \/>\n\tLet other people overreact to the market.To succeed in the market, you need only ordinary intelligence. But in addition, you need the kind of temperament to help you ride out the storms and stick to your long-term plans. If you can stay cool while those around you are panicking, you can surely prevail.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Be Patient<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThink 10 years, rather than 10 minutes Don\u2019t dwell on the price of stocks. Instead, study the underlying business, its earnings capacity and its future. If the question is, \u201cHow long will you wait?\u201d \u2013 \u201cIf we\u2019re in the right place, we\u2019ll wait indefinitely\u201d says Buffet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Buy Business, Not Stocks <\/strong><br \/>\n\tOnce you get into the right business, you can let everyone else worry about the stock market. Business performance is the key to picking stocks. Study the long-term track record of any company that is on your buy list. Buffet looks for following five main things before investing in a company.<br \/>\n\t(i) Business he can understand<br \/>\n\t(ii) Companies with favorable long-term prospects<br \/>\n\t(iii) Business operated by honest and competent people<br \/>\n\t(iv) Businesses priced very attractively<br \/>\n\t(v) Business with free cash flow<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t think about \u201cstock in the short term.\u201d Think about \u201cbusiness in the long term\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Look for a Company that is a Franchise<\/strong><br \/>\n\tSome businesses are \u201cfranchises\u201d. Franchise generates free cash flows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Buy Low-Tech, Not High-Tech<\/strong><br \/>\n\tSuccessful investing is rarely a gee-whiz activity. It\u2019s less often about rockets and lasers and more often about bricks, carpets, paint, shaving blades and insulation.<br \/>\n\tDo not be tempted by get-rich-quick deals involving relatively complex companies (e.g., high-tech companies). They are the most unpredictable in the long run. Look for the absence of change. Look for the business whose only change in the future will be doing more business, e.g Gillette Blades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Concentrate Your Stock Investments<\/strong><br \/>\n\tA the \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d style of investing \u2013 that is, a little of this, a little of that. Better to have a smaller number of investments with more of your money in each.Portfolio concentration \u2013 the opposite of diversification \u2013 also has the power to focus the mind. If you\u2019re putting your eggs in only a few baskets, you\u2019re far less likely to make investments on impulse or emotion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Practice Inactivity, Not Hyperactivity<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThere are times when doing nothing is a sign of investing brilliance. Be a decade\u2019s trader, not a day trader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Don\u2019t Look at the Ticker<\/strong><br \/>\n\tTickers are all about prices. Investing is about a lot more than prices. It is about value. It is about wealth. Abstain from looking at share prices every day. Study the playing field and not the scoreboard. Know the value of something rather than the price of everything<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>11. View Market Downturns as Buying Opportunities <\/strong><br \/>\n\tMarket downturns aren\u2019t body blows; they are buying opportunities. Change your investing mind-set. Reprogram your thinking. Learn to like a sinking market because it presents great buying opportunity. Pounce when the three variables come together. When a strong business with an enduring competitive advantage, strong management, and a low stock price come onto your investment screen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>12. Don\u2019t Swing at Every Pitch<\/strong><br \/>\n\tWhat if you had to predict how every stock in the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s (S&amp;P) 500 would do over the next few years? In this scenario you have very poor chance of being correct. But if your job was to find only one stock among those 500 that would do well? In this revised scenario you have a good chance.A few good investments are all that is needed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>13. Ignore the Macro; Focus on the Micro<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe big things \u2013 the large trends that are external to the business \u2013 don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the little things, the things that are business-specific, that count. It\u2019s possible to imagine a cataclysm so terrible that the markets would collapse and not bounce back. Externalities don\u2019t matter \u2013 and you can\u2019t predict them, anyway. And what can you do about them? Focus on what you can know: the workings of a good business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>14. Take a Close Look at Management<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe analysis begins \u2013 and sometimes ends \u2013 with one key question: Who\u2019s in charge here? Assess the management team before you invest. A investing in any company that has a record of financial or accounting shenanigans, (creative accounting, accounting jugglery). Weak accounting usually means weak business performance. Strong companies do not have to resort to tricks.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>15. Remember, The Emperor Wears No Clothes on Wall Street<\/strong><br \/>\n\tWall Street is the only place where people go to in Rolls Royce to get advice from people who take the subway.Ignore the charts. A value investor is not concerned with charts. Invest like Benjamin Graham. Graham told investors to \u201csearch for discrepancies between the value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in the market.\u201d This is the key to value investing, and it\u2019s far more productive than getting dizzy studying hundreds of stock charts. Offer documents of most mutual funds say \u2013 in small print \u2013 that past performance is no guarantee of future success. Buffet says the same thing about the market: If history revealed the path to riches, librarians would be rich.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>16. Practice Independent Thinking<\/strong><br \/>\n\tWhen investing, you need to think independently. Make independent thinking one of your portfolio\u2019s greatest assets. Being smart isn\u2019t good enough, says Buffet. Lots of high-IQ people fall victim to the herd mentality. Independent thinking is one of Buffet\u2019s greatest strengths. Make it one of your own.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>17. Stay within Your Circle of Competence <\/strong><br \/>\n\tDevelop a zone of expertise, operative within that zone. Write down the industries and businesses with which you feel most comfortable. Confine your investments to them.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>18. Ignore Stock Market Forecasts<\/strong><br \/>\n\tShort-term forecasts of stock or bond prices are useless. They tell you more about the forecaster than they tell you about the future. Take the time you would spend listening to forecasts and instead use it to analyze a business\u2019s track record. Develop an investing strategy that does not depend on the overall movement of the market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>19. Understand \u201cMr. Market\u201d and the \u201cMargin of Safety\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\n\tWhat makes for a good investor? A good investor is one who combines good business judgment with an ability to ignore the wild swings of the marketplace. When the emotions start to swirl, remember Ben Graham\u2019s \u201cMr. Market\u201d concept, and look for a \u201cmargin of safety\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you also understand Buffet\u2019s concepts of Mr. Market and the margin of safety. Like the Lord, the market helps those who help themselves. But, unlike God, the market doesn\u2019t forgive those who \u201cknow not what they do\u201d. Bid your time, and wait for Mr. Market to get depressed and lower stock prices enough to provide a margin-of-safety buying opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>20. Be Fearful when Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful<\/strong><br \/>\n\tYou can safely predict that people will be greedy, fearful, or foolish. Trouble is you just can\u2019t predict when or in what order.Buy when people are selling and sell when people are buying.<\/p>\n<p><strong>21. Read, Read Some More, and Then Think<\/strong><br \/>\n\tMr. Warren Buffet spends something like six hours a day reading and an hour or two on the phone. The rest of the time, he thinks. He therefore advises get in the habit of reading. The best thing to start is to read Buffett\u2019s annual reports and letters. Finally, restrict your time only to things worth reading.<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>22. Use All Your Horsepower<\/strong><br \/>\n\tHow big is your engine, and how efficiently do you put it to work? Warren Buffett suggests that lots of people have \u201c400 \u2013 horsepower engines\u201d but only 100 horsepower of output. Smart people, in other words, often allow themselves to get distracted from the task at hand and act in irrational ways. The person who gets full output from a 200-horse-power engine, says Buffett, is a lot better off. Make sure that you have the right role models. Strive for rational behaviour, good habits, and proper temperament. Write down the habits, practices and philosophies that you want to make your own. Then be sure to keep track of them and eventually own them. Financial success is a \u201cmatter of having the right habits\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>23. A the Costly Mistakes of Others<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThis is self explanatory and need no comments!<\/p>\n<p>\t<strong>24. Become a Sound Investor <\/strong><br \/>\n\tBuffet says that Ben Graham was about \u201csound investing\u201d. He wasn\u2019t about brilliant investing or fads and fashions, and the good thing about sound investing is that it can make you wealthy if you are in not too much of a hurry, and it never makes you poor. To become a sound investor, you need to develop sound investing habits. Always fight the noise to get the real story. Always practice continuous improvement.It\u2019s less about solving difficult business problems, says Warren Buffet, and more about a ing them. It\u2019s about finding and stepping over \u201cone-foot hurdles\u201d rather than developing the extraordinary skills needed to clear seven-foot hurdles.<\/p>\n"
